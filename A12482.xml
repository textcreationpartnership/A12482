            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Oh that I would pleaſe his Maieſtie to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this combat, that Bel, &amp; I (the weakeſt
<pb facs="tcp:11214:25"/> of many thouſands of Gods ſoldiers) might try the truth, not by writing, which blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth not (as Tully ſaid) but face to face as the Bishop of Eureux, and Pleſſy did before the French King. I doubt not but if there were any blood in Bels body, or any shame of men in his minde, I shold make it appeare in his face. But whiles this combat muſt be fought a far of, only by paper shot, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and our writings kept from the view of the people, no meruail if Bel feare no shame of men, whiles they may ſee him fight, &amp; florish, but muſt not behold ether defence or blowes of his aduerſary.</p>
            <p>If he be ſo confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in his Hereſy (which he once vomited forth, and now like the dog hath lickt vp again) as he maketh shew of, why hath he not in al this tyme of his Apoſtaſy procured lycence for publike diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation? or at leſt, why neuer repaired he to the Catholique Prieſts in priſon? Let him procure but one ſuch ſafe conducte for Prieſts as the councel of Trent graunted <note place="margin">Seſſ. 13. 15. 18.</note> three or fowre to Proteſtants (when none of our English Miniſters durſt accept it) &amp; he shal not need to challenge, or adiure, but shal be dared at his owne dore. For Prieſts who willingly ſpend their blood in teſtimony of the truth which they teach, wil far ſooner ſpend their breath in defence
<pb facs="tcp:11214:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> therof, &amp; are ready (to make the like offer <note place="margin">Epistle to the King.</note> as Bel doth in a different matter) to iuſtify it before indifferent iudges againſt him, or what Proteſtant ſoeuer vpon peril of their liues, if their aduerſaries wil aduenture the like peril. And vpon this condition Bel I challenge thee, and adiure thee, accept it if thou dareſt. What more could haue bene done to bring this ſo weighty a matter, wherupon dependeth the eternal ſaluation of ſo many millions of ſoules to tryal face to face, then hath bene done of Catholiques by ſpeaking, by writing, by petition, by ſupplication? Puritans vpon one only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication haue bene admitted to Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Catholiques can vpon none. And this is that which maketh Bel ſo bold to challeng vs to the open combat, when he knoweth we can not appeare in open shew, but vpon hazard of our liues. And I wold to God that with danger, yea with loſſe of life we might be lyce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced publikly to try this truth ſo important to the eternal life of our deareſt countrimen. But ſeeing there is no hope of this, when I red Bels challenge it ſeemed to me not only an vnlearned thing, patcht vp of obiections gathered out of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin, and learnedly anſwered by him, but a witles challenge of ſome coward, who ſeeing his enemy commanded vpon pain of
<pb facs="tcp:11214:26"/> death to keep his houſe, callengeth him to the open field, and more like to condemne the Author of folly, and vanity; then the Catholique religion of falſity before any diſcreet, &amp; iudicious Reader. Neuertheles becauſe (as I vnderſtood ſome monthes after the publishing of it) ſome vnaduiſed Proteſtants hearing Bels glorious vaunts and challeng, had conceaued great hope of this their Champion, &amp; thought his booke vna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwerable, I took it in hand not knowing as then that any other wold vouchſafe to <note place="margin">Author of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of Bels dovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefal.</note> medle with it, &amp; haue left to my knowledg no one point therin vnanſwered, attending more to ſolue what he obiecteth, then to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme what Catholikes mantein, though this alſo I haue done ſufficiently (as I hope) for my intended breuity.</p>

I wil diſproue his vntruthes, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11214:33" rendition="simple:additions"/> diſcouer his diſſimulations; and afterward compare the opinion and practiſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants &amp; Catholiques touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter together: whereby the indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may, by Bels euil and corrupt dealing in the very beginning of his chalenge take a taſte of the reſt of his proceedings. for, as Tertullian ſaith well, <hi>vvhat truth doe they</hi>

Yf theſe (Maiſter Bel) be they whome ye meane, I tel you in their name, that as your propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath two parts, viz. the Popes Superiority ouer al Princes and of his power to depoſe them, ſo it contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth three (to vſe your owne tearme) flatte leaſinges.</p>
               <p>For though, concerning Chriſtians, they beleeue the Pope to be ſpiritually ſuperiour aboue al whatſoeuer accordinge to Chriſts words ſpoken to the firſt Pope S. Peter, Matth. 16. viz. <hi>Thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke vvil I buylde my Church,</hi> and Io. 21. v. 17. <hi>Feede my sheepe,</hi> which sheepe conteine and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11214:34"/> include as wel Chriſtian Princes and poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates as ſubiects and vnderlings. And, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning infidels, they alſo beleeue that the Pope ought to be ſpiritually aboue them, and they vnder him in that they be bound to be Chriſtians: neuertheleſſe, vntil theſe be Chriſtened, he is not actually their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour: vntil they be made members of Chriſts Church, he is not <hi>de facto</hi> their head: vntil they be in Chriſts fould, he is not their sheape hearde. For, as Bellarmin wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; <note place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 5. de Rom. Pont. c. 7. Bel p. 29. 125.</note> whoſe teſtimonie (ſaith Bel) is moſt ſufficient in al Popiſshe affaires, <hi>Christ vvas aboue as vvel infidels as faithful; But to S. Peter he committed onely his sheepe, that is the faithful.</hi> Wherefore S. Paul as not acknowledging that he had any ſuperiority or iuriſdiction ouer infidels ſaid, <hi>vvhat belongeth it to me to iudge of them that are vvithout?</hi> 1. Cor. 5. And although the Pope may preach him ſelfe or ſend others to preache to infidels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their licence, yet this argueth no more but that the commiſſion which he hath from God to preach the Ghoſpel vnto al nations is independent of the infidels, and that they ought to be vnder his iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherefore vntil Bel doe prooue that there are no powers or pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The ſecond parte of his Propoſition touching the Popes depoſition of Princes <note place="margin">pag. 1. 4. 17.</note> at his pleaſure, though he repeat it thriſe is moſt vntrue.

Becauſe Bellarmin calleth the Pope Paſtor of the Church, Bel auoucheth him to think the Pope to be aboue al Princes, &amp; Potentates on earth; as if there were no Princes infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, or out of the Church: and becauſe he teacheth that the Pope may excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and depoſe Princes for Hereſy, that he may depoſe them at his pleaſure, as if mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Hereſy (which is one of the greateſt ſinns that is) were the Popes pleaſure. An indifferent reader would rather haue infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that becauſe the Pope is Paſtor of the Church, he is not aboue any infidel, Prince, or ſubiect; which Bellarmin teacheth in <note place="margin">Bellarmin.</note> expreſſe words in the ſame booke c. 2. &amp;c. 4. And becauſe he can not exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11214:36"/> ſo neither depoſe Princes for his pleaſure, which Bellarmin euery where ſuppoſeth, yea in the ſame book c. 6. auoucheth. That <hi>ordinarily he can not depoſe Princes euen for iuſt cauſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. But let vs heare Bel diſproue him ſelf; <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Secular Prieſts</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>write plainly and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly that the Pope hath no power to depriue Kings of their royal Scepters, and regalities, nor to giue away their Kingdomes to an other. In which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> likewiſe the French Papiſts do concurre, &amp; iump with them.</hi> Item. <hi>The Seculars, although they acknowledge the Popes power ſupereminent in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualibus yet do they diſclaime from it in tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus when he taketh vpon him to depoſe Kinges from their empires and tranſlate their Kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.</hi> And leaſt we should thinke theſe few Prieſts, who wrote ſo, were no Papiſts, Bel him ſelf teſtifieth that they are <hi>the Popes deare Vaſſals and profeſſe the ſelfe ſame religion with</hi>

               </p>
               <p>8. The third vntruth conteined in the propoſition is that we teach the doctrine of his propoſition as a pointe of our faith: wherevpon he inferreth in his concluſion, our religion and faith to be falſe. Becauſe we teach no ſuch doctrine at al and much leſſe as a point of our religion or faith. And the graueſt &amp; beſt learned amongſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques attribute to rhe Pope onely ſpiritual
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11214:36"/> ſuperiority ouer Princes, and power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them in that caſe wherin our Sauiour ſaid Math. 18. that it were better for a man to be caſt into the ſea then to liue, to wit, when they ſo ſcandalize others as their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is neceſſary for the ſaluation of ſoules as I haue already shewed out af Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin, <note place="margin">Bel. parag. 29.</note> whoſe teſtimony in this matter Bel can not refuſe ſeing he calleth him the mouth of Papiſts and auoucheth his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin to be the Popes owne doctrin. And this doctrin good Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Princes account no more preiudicial or iniurious to their eſtates, then they do the like doctrin of S. Paul 2. Cor. 10. where he profeſſeth him ſelf to haue power to deſtroy al loftines extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, &amp; to be ready to punish al diſobedience.</p>
               <p>9. Wherfore, to requite Bel with a ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme like vnto his owne, I argue thus: you Bel tel vs that we Papiſts ſaie, the Pope is aboue al powers and potentates on earth, that he can depoſe Kings and Emperours, and tranſlate their empiers at his good wil and pleaſure, But this your tale is a very tale falſe, abſurd, and nothing elſe but a mere fable: and conſequently your late chalenge conſiſteth of mere falſehoods fables &amp; flat leaſings. The propoſition is your owne wordes, the truth of the aſſumption appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11214:37"/> by my anſwer to your argument. And thus much touching Bels vntruthes vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his propoſition and proofe therof, now let vs come to his diſſemblinge.</p>

                  </gap>e meaneth nothing leſſe then to frame (as he promiſſeth) a plaine, and ſincer ſolution vnto it. And yet the obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction though ſo ſillily propounded, not onely much trobleth many vulgar people (as he ſaith) but puſleth him ſelfe ſo, as after ſeuen leaues ſpent to diuert the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders minde, &amp; to make him forget (as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritiks <note place="margin">The manner of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in anſvvering Catholiks.</note> vſe to do) the argument, which he can not anſwer, he fyndeth no better ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then to graunt what the Antecendent
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:11214:49"/> contayneth and to ſay nothing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent following therof.</p>
               <p>2. Wherfore becauſe Bel was ſo trobled with the matter of this obiection, as he forgot the forme, I wil ſupply his default, and argue thus in forme. He by whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority the Empire was tranſlated, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Emperor appointed, and the elected is confirmed, and whoſe ſuperiority ouer them many Emperors haue willingly acknowledged, hath ſome ſuperiority ouer Emperors: but the Pope is ſuch, as by his authority the Empire &amp;c. Ergo the Pope hath ſome ſuperiority ouer Emperors. The forme is ſyllogiſtical and good. The Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is manifeſt, for no power or dignity can be truly tranſlated, or confirmed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors or equals, but onely by ſuperiors: none (eſpecially) willingly acknowledge as ſuperior, whome they thinke is not.</p>
               <p>3. The Aſſumption contayneth three parts expreſſed in the Propoſition, wherof the firſt vz. That the Empire was tranſlated by the Popes authority Bellarm: l. de tranſl: <note place="margin">Bellarmin.</note> Imper: c. 4 proueth by the teſtimony of 33. writers &amp;c 5. by the confeſſion of 11. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors: and Princes, and c. 6. by aſſertion of 7. Popes. Yea Bel (though with much a doe) confeſſeth it page. 12. ſaying. <hi>That Charles the great</hi> (to whome the Empire was
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:11214:50"/> firſt tranſlated) <hi>was made Emperor by Pope Leo</hi> 3. <hi>for reſtoring him to his place, and dignity, being driuen out by the Romans,</hi> though ſoone <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 13.</note> after he condemne the Pope of treaſon for this tranſlation. But differing the queſtion of treaſon til a non (which hindreth not the verity of the tranſlation if the tranſlator haue power to transfer: as a ſouldier may by gift, or ſale truly, and yet trayterouſly tranſlate his armes, and munition to the Enemies) I ask of Bel, whether the Pope did truly tranſlate the Empire, or no. If he did, then hath the Pope power to tranſlate Empires: If he did not, then was nether Charles the great, nor any of his ſucceſſors to this day true Emperors. And if the Pope be Antichriſt (as Bel auoucheth) for depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome few Emperors for iuſt cauſes; Bel may be wel accounted Lucifer, for depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing at once, and for no fault at al, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors of the weſt, which haue bene theſe 800. yeares. But Proteſtants haue great <note place="margin">Proteſtants can make &amp; vnmake Emperors vvhen they liſt.</note> cunning in making and vnmaking Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, according as it redoundeth in their opinion to the grace or diſgrace of Popes. For when the Pope depoſeth them, they be true Emperors, but when he maketh, them, <hi>they haue onely</hi> (as Willet writeth) <hi>the name</hi>

If falſe, he did a good deed in depoſing them: If true, then hath the Pope authority to make true Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, and tranſlate Empiers.</p>
               <p>4. The ſecond parte included in my Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption vz. That the Pope appointed the electors of the Emperor, and confirmed the elected, touching the apointing of electors is confeſſed by Bel pag. 14. and touching the confirmation is conteſted by many hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriographers, and practized by as many as are crowned Emperors. The laſt parte vz, that Emperors haue acknowledged the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes ſuperiority Bel him ſelf confeſſeth page 17. where he ſayth, <hi>That ſome Cbristian Kings and Emperors haue vpon a blynd Zeale humbled them ſelues to the Pope,</hi> yea (which is more) <hi>haue yeldeed vp their ſoueraigne rights to him.</hi> And shal not the Pope be ſuperior to them, who haue humbled them ſelues &amp; yeelded their ſoueraingties vnto him?</p>
               <p>5. But what shift hath Bel to auoide this? <note place="margin">

Catholiques argue that Kings, and Emperors haue acknowledged Popes their ſuperiors, this Bel graunteth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their humiliation to Popes, which is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:11214:51"/> neuer done, but to Superiors. and addeth that they haue yeelded vp their Souereigne rights, which is more then the obiection contayneth. And what he addeth of blynd zeale maketh nothing to the purpoſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the queſtion is not vpon what cauſe Kings, and Emperors humbled them ſelues to the Popes, but whither they did or no. And becauſe they haue ſo done (as Bel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth) Catholiques infer the Pope to be their Superior. Vnles perhaps Bel think blynd zeale to diſanul euery fact, or gift, and ſo ſay the Iewes perſecuted not the Church, becauſe they did it vpon blynd zeale.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:11214:54"/> with the challeng of equality.</p>
               <p>5. But I deny that euer any Catholique attributed to the Pope power proper to God: let vs therfore conſider Gerſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. The firſt point <hi>is, that Christ hath giuen al the power in heauen and earth to S. Peter, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Bels ſlander toucheth as vvel S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the auncient Popes as the late.</note>

Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him ſelf, though Bel be ashamed to charg them with this ſtaunder, are theſe woords of Popish paraſits? doe they giue to men power proper to God alone? Then was S. Chriſoſtome a Popish paraſite, and <note place="margin">S. Chryſoſt. lib. 3. de ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdot.</note> gaue to Prieſts power proper to God, when he ſaid. <hi>Priests haue al power of heauenly things, and the very ſelf ſame al kind of power which Christ had of his Father.</hi> S. Baſil ſayth, <note place="margin">S. Baſil. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. de poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent. S. Leo ſerm. 2. de Natali Pet. &amp; Pauli.</note> 
                  <hi>that Christ gaue this authority to others.</hi> S. Leo writeth <hi>that S. Peter had thoſe things by partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, which Christ had proper by power.</hi> or doth Bel think that our King in creating a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty in Ireland, and giuing him authority to gouerne that Kingdome, giueth him power proper to Kings? Are deputies Kings are they no more ſubiects? True it is that the power which Popes haue, came from God alone as the authority of deputies co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from Kings, but ſuch power by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is no more proper to God, then the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:11214:55" rendition="simple:additions"/> like in deputies is proper to Kings.</p>
               <p>6. The ſecond point in Gerſons report is that the forſaid nameles perſons cal the Pope <hi>Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.</hi> If theſe be paraſits words and make men equal to God then was Daniel a paraſite, &amp; he made Nabuchodonozor equal to God in calling him <hi>King of Kings.</hi> Vnles Bel allow this <note place="margin">Daniel. 2. v. 37.</note> title in a heathen Prince and account it blaſphemy in a Chriſtian.

Bernard no paraſite but a holy writer (in Caluins opinion) calleth the Pope <hi>Prince of Bishops, leader of Chriſtians, hammer of tyrants, father of Kings, Vicar of Chriſt, Christ of the Lord, and God of Pharao.</hi> And thus ſpoke S. Bernard euen in thoſe books, where (according to Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins <note place="margin">Caluin. l. 4. c. 11. paragr. 11.</note> iudgment) <hi>he ſpoke it ſo as truth it ſelfe ſemed to ſpeake.</hi> And albeit the Pope do not entitle him ſelfe King of Kings but <hi>Seruant of Gods ſeruants,</hi> which is a more humble ſtile, then any Prince vſeth: yet rightly might he, becauſe he hath twoe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, vz.

               <p>7. But becauſe Bel is ſo hard aconſtruer of ſome Catholiques words, let vs heare,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:11214:55"/> not a paraſite, but a Proteſtant Prelat, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king not in abſence but in preſence of the King and realme. Bilſon in his late ſermon <note place="margin">Bilſon.</note> at the Kings coronation ſaith <hi>Kings be Gods by office, they haue the ſociety of his name, are in his place, their very robes are ſanctified, euery thing belonging to them is ſacred, are pertakers, with Chriſt in the power, honour, and iuſtice of his Kingdome on earth, and partake with Gods homage,</hi> Behould he calleth Kings Gods, and partners with God in his name, power, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and homage, and yet no Catholique chardgeth Proteſtants that they attribute to the King, or that he challengeth power proper to God alone.</p>
               <p>8. The third point reprehended by Bel in Gerſons reporte, is that eccleſiaſtical and temporal power is ſaid to come from the Pope. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith Bel pag: 16.) <hi>is to make the Pope author of al power, a thing proper to God.</hi>

                  </note> This ſay I is for Bel to vtter two vntruthes at once: for neither do they ſpeake of al power, but only of power in earth, which they deuide into eccleſiaſtical &amp; temporal, beſides which there is power in heauen of God, and Saints: neither do they make the Pope, author of al power in earth, but only ſaie it commeth from the Pope, which is not to make him author therof, vnles Bel wil make euery officer author of what he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:11214:56" rendition="simple:additions"/> doth in the Princes name, euery inſtrument author of the effect it worketh by vertue of the cauſe. And thus much touching this ſlaunder of Popes, impoſed by Bel. Now let vs come to others, for no other ſtuffe we are like to hear hereafter in this article.</p>

               <p>8. What therefore Platina ſaieth had bene wont to be done before, about ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the confirmation of the Emperour, or his deputie in Italy, he vnderſtood of the time ſince Pope Vigilius (excepting Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius

               <p>12. To diſproue the two firſt vntruths <note place="margin">Bel diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by him ſelfe.</note> I need no other witnes then Bel him ſelfe, who (pag: 8.) affirmed that <hi>from the yeare</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:11214:64"/> 471. <hi>vntil Carolus Magnus</hi> (which was 801.) <hi>Barbarians poſſeſſed al Italie.</hi> If from 471. vntil 801. Barbarians poſſeſſed al Italie, how <note place="margin">

               <p>13. The truth is that Barbarians poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">Baron. in annal.</note> Italie from the yeare 476. for more then 80. yeares, after which time the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Emperour in the yeare 553. recouered al Italie, and albeit they loſt shortly after in the yeare 568 a great part therof, yet they kept Rome vntil about the yeare 726. Onuph ſaith 731, when both Rome and <note place="margin">Onuphr. in chron. Baron. in annal.</note> Italie reuolted from Leo 3. Emperour of Conſtantinople for his hereſie againſt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, and would then haue choſen an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Emperour againſt him, if Gregory the ſecond then Pope had not diſſwaded them. Since which time Rome was neuer vnder the Emperours of Conſtantinople. And therefore neither were the Popes ſubiect to Emperours 800. yeares after Chriſt: nor did Pope Leo commit any treaſon againſt the Grecian Emperors, by creating Charles Emperour in the yeare 801. which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a hundred yeares after the reuolt of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:11214:65"/> Italy from the greekes. As for the third vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth it is euident, becauſe Sigebert doth not cal the grecian Emperour ſoueraigne to to the Romans: And the word <hi>deſciuerant</hi> ſignifieth any for ſaking or leauing of one, whether he be his ſoueraigne or no.</p>
               <p>14. But Bel goeth on in erring the Pope <note place="margin">

               <p>15. The truth is that Pipin gaue not the exarchate to Greg. 3 who died in the yeare 741 or as other write 740, fourteene yeares before Pipins entrance into Italie, neither was Pipin then a King, but made afterward by Zachary ſucceſſor to Gregory as Bel te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth page 19. but to Pope Steeuen 2. as is apparant (to vſe Bels words) by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of many renowmed Cronographers, though ſome cal him Steeuen 3. becauſe they reckon his predeceſſour, whom others
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:11214:65"/> omit, becauſe he liued but foure daies, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe al writers agree that Lewes pius con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the donation of his grandfather Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin <note place="margin">Apud Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. diſt. 63. can. ego Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douicus.

               <p>16. And Bels prouing the hiſtoriographers <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bel pag.</hi> 13.</note> to diſagree, becauſe Blondus and Platina (ſaith he) write that Pipin gaue the exar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate to Gregory the third, Regino referreth it to Steeuen, and Sigebert ſaith Pipin had Italy in his owne poſſeſſion in the yeare 801. is like the reſt of his proceedings. For that of Platina is a manifeſt vntruth, for he ſaith <note place="margin">Platina in Stephan. 2. Naucler. ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. 26. Palmerius in chronic. Claud. Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di. in Pepin. paragr. 6. 7. 8. 9.</note> Pipin gaue the exarchate in Pope Steeuen the ſecond his time, and Sigebert meaneth not of King Pipin the giuer of the exarchate who died 768, but of his grandchild ſonne to Carolus Magnus, and how his poſſeſſion of Italy doth not preiudicate the Pope, is before explicated. Regino ſaith that which is truth, for beſt authors agree, that Pipin gaue the exarchate in the yeare 755. at What time Steeuen 2. al. 3. was Pope.</p>
               <p>17. But ſuppoſe writers did not agree about the Pope to whome, and time, when Pipin made his guift of the exar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate, muſt we therefore needs deny the guift in which they al agree? So wee
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:11214:66"/> might deny that Chriſt Was borne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe writers agree not about the time: is it not vſual for hiſtoriographers to agree in the ſubſtance of the narration, and yet dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in ſome circumſtance of the perſon, or time?</p>
               <p>18. Laſt of al leaſt we should thinke the Grecian Emperors, acknowledged Charles made by the Pope to be true Emperour, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bel pag.</hi> 14. Sigebert.

Wherein the ſilly foole ouerthroweth what he before ſaid. For if the Pope did not tranſlate the Empire, then was it no ſteppe to his tiranny, as he imagineth.</p>
               <p>19. But let vs heare how he proueth, that the Grecian Emperours did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hnowledge Charles the great for true Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, firſt forſooth <hi>becauſe Sigebert ſaith, they had indignation againſt Charles;</hi> what then?
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:11214:66"/> are neuer Emperours offended for any thing lawfullie done, eſpeciallie if they thinke it preiudice their eſtate &amp; dignity? and albeit Sigebert affirme, that ſome Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Emperours (who them ſelues came vnlawfullie and by tiranny to the Empire, and that after Charles was crowned Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) had indignation againſt Charles; yet none write that Irene (who was the only &amp; lawful Empreſſe at that time, when Charles was created) was offended with his creation, but rather content, as may be gathered by hir purpoſe which (as Zonoras and Cedrenus write) she had to marry him, Yea Nauclerus ſaith, ſhe was depoſed for <note place="margin">Naucler. ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. 28.</note> the fauor ſhe bore to Charles, beſides the indignation of thoſe Emperours vz. Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus, Michael, and Leo, was not ſo much for the Imperial dignity taken by Charles, as becauſe, as writeth Eginhart, Charles <note place="margin">Eginhart in vita Caroli.</note> his ſecretary, <hi>they greatlie ſuſpected leaſt he should take the Empire from them;</hi> which they might iuſtlie feare, becauſe by tirany and depoſition of their predeceſſors, they had gotten it, and yet notwithſtanding their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, of their owne accord they ſent Embaſſadours to Charles, and made league and friendshippe with him, as the ſame Eginhart, Ado, and others teſtifie. Yea the Magdeburgians adde, that the <hi>Grecians in a</hi>

               </p>
               <p>20. His other proofe out of Platina con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth an vntruth, for Platina writeth that <note place="margin">Platina in Ieone 3.</note> Charles being made Emperour, Irene ſent Embaſſadours to make peace and league with him, &amp; to deuide Italie betwixt them, which league Nicephorus renued: but he hath no word of Charles his ruling the weſt with their fouours, more then of their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Eaſt with his.

And ſeing this conſtitution hath euer ſince bene inuiolablie obſerued, and the Emperours ſo elected accompted as true Emperours throughout al Chriſtendome, a ſigne it is that Chriſtians thinke the Pope hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to appoint Electors, who may chooſe what Emperour they pleaſe, by the authority giuen them from the Pope. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would Bel anſwered me this dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. The ſeauen Electors haue authority to chooſe an Emperour, or not?

                  <hi>they challenge the royal right of both ſwords throughout the Chriſtian world, and haue made thereof a flat decree.</hi> But firſt I deny that the Pope, as Pope, challengeth royal right of either ſword. For his right to the ſpiritual ſword is not royal, but of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as is euident, &amp; shal be declared here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: and his royal right to the material ſword, is neither ouer al chriſtendome, as Bel vntruelie auoucheth, but only ouer the Popedome: nor he challendgeth it by his Papacie, yea (as Pope Gelaſius wrote) <hi>Popes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gelaſius de vincul. ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematis. &amp; Nicol. 1. dec. 96. can. cum ad vetum. <hi>pag.</hi> 17. Bernard. lib. 4. de conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratione.</note> 
                  <hi>haue not challendged royal ſoueraigntie,</hi> but by the guifte of Princes, who as Bel ſaith haue giuen their rights to them. And albeit the decree doe (after S.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:11214:68"/> by the hand of the ſouldier, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the Emperour, and becke of the Pope. Whereby we ſee, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree attributeth royal right, of the material ſword, only to the Emperour, who is to commaund the ſouldier to draw, and vſe it, and to the Pope only authority to direct the Emperour in his commaund and vſe of his ſword.</p>
               <p>23. But ſuppoſe that Popes did challenge royal right of both ſwords, throughout the chriſtian world, is this to climbe to the higheſt heauen and to Chriſtes throne? doth the chriſtian world reach to the higheſt heauen? or yet to the bounds of the earth? doth Chriſtes throne rule no more then the chriſtian worlde? or doth royal authority vnder him, reach to his throne? ſurelie Bel hath a baſe conceipt of Chriſtes kingdome, if he imagine that Popes, or Princes by their authorities, reach to his throne, who (as S.

But wel I ſee that which doth not diſpleaſe Bel, if it be giuen to Princes; he condemneth as intolerable blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, if it be attributed to Popes. For the foreſaid words are al in the ciuil lawe, and by the Emperours applied either to them ſelues, or to the Pope: as the Emperours <hi>Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodoſius de ſum.</hi>

Who therefore can doubt but their doctrin is the doctrin of diuils, and they, ſuch as hauing departed from the Catholique faith, wherein they were chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtend, and bred, did harken to the ſpirits of errors, and teach the doctrin, which they had learnd of the diuil appearinge in viſible forme.

                  </note> could not be ignorant that Luther, and his Lutherish brood hold the real preſence of Chriſts body, and blood in the Euchariſt, no les then Catholiques, though otherwiſe then they doe. For Luther accurſeth them <note place="margin">Luther. in praefat. lib. Sueuarum. In poſtrema confeſ. fidei de caena Domini. Et theſti. 15. &amp; 27.</note> and accounteth them blaſphemers, and damned foreuer, and in plaine teatmes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineth them to be <hi>heretiques and out of Gods church, who denie the body and bloud of Chriſt to be receaued with carnal mouth in the venerable Euchariſt.</hi> This was Luthers ſentence &amp; iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them that deny the real preſence, <note place="margin">Ioan.

               <p>6. Bells want of fidelitie appeareth in this propoſition whereof he maketh no doubt. For albeit al Catholiques beleue as a point of their faith, that Chriſts true and natural body and the very ſelfe ſame which in heauen is organical, is in the B: Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet nether the Councel of Trent, S. <note place="margin">Conc. Trid. ſeſſ. 13. can. 1. S. Thom. 3. p. q. 76. art. 1. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Euchar. c. 2.</note> Thomas nor Bellarmin in the places quoted by Bel, affirme as a point (and much leſſe as an Article) of their faith, that it is there or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical. For organization being an accident of the body depending of quantity, they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:11214:76"/> hold no otherwiſe his organization, then they do his quantity to be in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Councel onely defineth whole Chriſt, that is euery ſubſtantial part of him to be in the Euchariſt, without any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity or other accidents as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the words of the Canon. <hi>If any shal deny the body and blood together with the ſoul &amp; Diuinity of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently whole Chriſt to be in the Euchariſt &amp;c. be he accurſed.</hi> And in the ſame ſenſe ſayd S. Thom: 3 p: q. 76 ar: 1. that according to the Catholique faith whole Chriſt is in the Sacrament. And though art: 4. he teach that Chriſts quantity is alſo in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet affirmeth he it not as a point of faith. In like ſorte Bellarm: in the place which Bel citeth teacheth, and truly, that Chriſts quantity is in the Sacrament, but not with Bels addition, as a point of faith. And though l 3. de Euchar: c. 5. he cal it the common ſentence of the Schooles and Church, yet condemneth he not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as heretical, but onely as falſe and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous. And as for Durand accom Gabriel <note place="margin">Durand. 4. d. 10. q. 2. Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam 4. q. 4. &amp; tract. de Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt. c. 29. maior. q. 2. Gabr. art. 2. concl. 2. &amp; lect. 43. in Can.</note> Maior, and Satus alſo as Sainctes reporteth (whome Bel can not deny to be of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish brood as he ſcornefully ſpeaketh) they thought that Chriſts body had not his qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity in the Sacrament and conſequently
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:11214:77"/> muſt needs thinke that it was not there or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical. And to diſproue Bel, Iuel in his apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie writeth, that ſome Papiſts affirme Chriſts quantity to be in the Euchariſt, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deny it. For ſome being perſwaded in Philoſophy, that quantity eſſentially requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth aptitudinal commenſuration to place, ſo that if it be put in a place it muſt needs be coextended to the place, &amp; thinking that they cold ſufficiently verifie Chriſts words by teaching the ſubſtance of his body to be in the Sacrament denied his quantity to be there, ſaying that God ſupplieth the effeſt therof ſo far forth as is neceſſary for the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le to informe the body, as in al Deuines opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he ſupplieth the effect of coextenſion to place, which alſo is a natural diſpoſition required to life and information of a body or matter. But other Deuines of greater learning and grauity (iudging it an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient thing to graunt Chriſts liuely body to want in the Sacrament his quantity and figure, and conſidering better of the nature of quantity, found that no commenſuration to place was eſſential vnto it, but onely a natural propriety, and therefore ſeparable by Gods power from it, as light is from the Sunne) taught that Chriſts hath his quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity in the Sacrament as a natural accident accompaning his body. And albeit this be
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:11214:77"/> a certaine truth and not onely the common opinion of Schooles but ſeemeth alſo to be the common ſenſe of Catholiques, yet ſaith Suarez a learned author Tom: 3. in 3. part. <note place="margin">Suarez</note> diſput: Si ſtec: 2. <hi>It is to hard a cenſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the contrary of hereſie. For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I find nether expreſſe definition nor irrefragable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Scripture againſt it, nor yet any thing which can be conuinced out of reuealed principles, and al the reaſons made againſt it, are deduced out of Philoſophical Principles, true and certaine but not altogether euident.</hi> In like ſorte Claudius de Sainctes repetit. 4. de Euchar: c. 4. teſtifieth <note place="margin">Sainctes.</note> that this matter is not clearly defined by the Church or Scripture. What shame therfore muſt it be to Bel to auouch that al Catholiks hold as a point of their faith that Chriſts body is organical in the Euchariſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the principal queſtion about the being of Chriſts body in the Sacrament (which is an vndoubted point of our faith, and againſt which his cheefe argument, which as he ſaith al the Papiſts in England can not anſwer taketh no hold) to impugne the being of Chriſts quantity in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt.</p>
               <p>7. Neuertheleſſe becauſe it is a thinge moſt true and moſt agreable to our faith. I willingly vndertake the defenſe therof. Let vs ſee therfore how Bel diſproueth it. For<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſooth

The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is euident. The Antecedent I proue, becauſe it is a point of the Catholique faith as teſtify S. Bede and S.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:11214:80"/> and others, and profeſſed in our Creed, that Chriſt was borne of a virgin, which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly <note place="margin">Ideo clauſa quia virgo.

And the contrary was the hereſie of Iouinian, who (as S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin writeth) affirmed that our Ladies vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity was loſt <hi>pariendo</hi> by child bearing, which he could not otherwiſe vnderſtand then by the Childs opening her womb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe virginity can not be otherwaies loſt <hi>pariendo</hi> by child bearing, and ſure it is she loſt not virginity by conceauing.</p>
               <p>14. Moreouer holy Fathers proue this truth out of that prophecy of Ezechiel 44. v. 2. <hi>of a gate shut and not opened by vvhich the Lord alone should paſſe</hi> vnderſtanding by this shut and vnopened gate the virginal womb of our B: Ladie. And Albeit ſome Fathers vſe the word of opening the womb in their ſpeech of our Ladies child birth, yet they meane not properly, but vſe the name of the effect for the natural cauſe therof. For becauſe children naturally do open their mothers wombs, both Scripture, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do ſometymes cal child bearing ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the womb, and barennes shutting the womb. Of Scripture this is euident out of Gen: 20: 29: 30. &amp; 1. reg: 1. of Fathers it is manifeſt by S. Hierome who though he <note place="margin">S. Hierom. dial. 2. cont. Pelagian.</note> ſay Chriſt opened the gate of the virgins
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:11214:81"/> womb, yet he addeth <hi>that it continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned shut,</hi> wherby he explicateth how before he took the opening vz. of Child bearing without any proper opening, for otherwiſe the womb could not remayne ſtil shut.</p>
               <p>15. Neuertheles Proteſtants, becauſe it maketh for the Catholique Doctrin of the B: Sacrament, deny the Antecedent, and Willet proueth their denyal, becauſe as S. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>VVillet cont.</hi> 13. <hi>p.</hi> 453. <hi>S. Luc.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 23.</note> Luke ſaith, <hi>Chriſt vvas preſented in the temple according to the lavv. Euery male opening the matrice shalbe holy to the Lord.</hi> But by the like reaſon he might proue that Chriſt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by mans ſeed, becauſe S. Luke in the ſame chapter writeth that our Lady was purifyed according to Moiſes law, which was as we read leu: 12. of <hi>a vvoman which hauing receaued ſeed had borne a male child.</hi> The anſwere to both places is the ſame. Becauſe naturally women conceiue by receauing ſeed, &amp; children are borne by opening their wombs, therfore the law vſed theſe termes. But as the one law affirmed not, that no woman could conceiue without receauing ſeed, ſo nether the other, that no child could be borne without opening his mothers womb. And as willets hereſy made him to open our Ladies wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>b, ſo his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience made him to shut it againe. For why should he
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:11214:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> teach that it was shut after her deliuery, if he did not thinke the opening did preiudice her virginity? The like proofe might be drawne out of Chriſts entring to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <note place="margin">See S. Hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie lib. cont. Conſtant. prope fine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> the dores being shut ſaith S. Luke, and of his iſſuing out of the ſepulchar before the Angel had remoued the ſtone.</p>
               <p>16. Secondly God can by his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency bring a Camel through a needles eye as wel as a rich man into heauen: but he can bring a rich man to heauen keeping his riches, Ergo a Camel keeping his greatnes through a needles eye. The Propoſition is euident out of our Sauiours words Math<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19. v. 24. 26. The Aſſumption is manifeſt and approued by S. Auſtin epiſt. 89. quaeſt. <note place="margin">S.

For to occupy place is an effect and accident of quantity, as to heate is of heate. Moreouer nature by condenſation doth make a body to occupy leſſe roome then is due vnto it, as appeareth in the freeſing of water, and this it doth with out deſtroying any quantity therof,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:11214:82" rendition="simple:additions"/> as many excellent Philoſophers euen by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon do gather. And can not God work the like effect without condenſation by ſome other ſupernatural meanes? Finally Bel teacheth that euery ſinne of it nature <note place="margin">

And thus much tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Bels reaſon. Now let vs ſee his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities.</p>

                  <hi>povver, but could not ſatisfy the Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. But ſuppoſe Caietan had ſaid as Bel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth. what then? Doth he therfore deny the real preſence, or think thoſe words not to be vnderſtood properly? no ſurely? yea he plainly auoucheth both. Or doth Bel think that euety point of faith is ſo euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly delyuered in Scripture, as the very words ſuffice to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince any reader though neuer ſo obſtinate? why then are not al heretiks co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted by reading Scripture? yea why ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytteth <note place="margin">

               <p>3. The ſecond is S. Tho: Aquinas <hi>whoe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">S. Thom. 4. d. 10. q. 1. art. 1. <hi>Bel p.</hi> 20.</note> (ſaith he) <hi>affirmeth conſtantly.

He contradicteth him ſelfe, for before he ſaid Aquinas held conſtantly as an article of the Chriſtian faith, that the true body of Chriſt is truly and really in the Sacrifice of the Maſſe: &amp; now he ſaith that he affirmeth conſtantly an aſſertion which is Bels flat poſition to the contrary. How
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:11214:83"/> can Aquinas hold conſtantly two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory points? He belyeth Aquinas, for he is ſo far from maintayning Bels poſition, as in the very place which Bel citeth, his concluſion is this. <hi>Vnder the Sacrament of the altar, is contayned the true body of Chriſt which he tooke of the virgin, and to ſay the contrary is hereſie.</hi> Laſtly he vnderſtandeth not Aquinas. <note place="margin">Bel vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas.</note> For he thinketh that Aquinas by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid words meaneth, that Chriſts body can not be in many places at once with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per dimenſions, &amp; therupon inferreth, that Aquinas thinketh Chriſts body can not be in many places at once, becauſe (ſaith Bel) <hi>it can not be without thoſe dimenſions which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally pertayne vnto it.</hi> But (to omit Bels im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious aſſertion, that God can not keep a body without his natural appurtenances) Aquinas meaning is playne and euident vz. That the total cauſe of Chriſts body being in two places at once, is not his owne dime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions alone, but they together with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of the body conuerted into his body. For he thinketh Chriſts owne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions to be the cauſe of his being in that place where he is naturally, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of the body which is tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, the cauſe of his being, where he is Sacramentally. Which opinion of his, about the cauſe of Chriſts being in many places,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:11214:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> maketh nothing to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>4. Thirdly he citeth Durand whom he <note place="margin">

But in this alſo he both contradicteth him ſelfe, &amp; belyeth Durand. For in the fourth mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this article, he telleth vs, that Durand <hi>holdeth the forme of bread to be changed</hi> vz. into the body of Chriſt. True it is that Durand (as before I cited) thinketh the quantity of Chriſts body not to be in the Euchariſt, yet neuertheles moſt conſtantly, he both affirmeth and proueth the ſubſtance of his body to be there.</p>
               <p>5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fourthly he alledgeth S. Auſtin wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. <note place="margin">

               <p>2. Firſt becauſe he did then giue his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> body vnto ſome, for his Apoſtles: But to no other then to God.

               <p>7. Againe <hi>Bellarmin</hi> (ſaith Bel) <hi>telleth vs that Chriſts body and blood are offered truly and properly in the Maſse.</hi> True: and the like ſaith S. Auſtin, S. Ambros, S. Chriſoſtome, and others. But doth Bel think euery thing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God to be killed? then was Chriſt killed when he was offered in the temple, Samuel, when he was offered by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and bread, wine, and frakincenſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the law, were killed. Thirdly he proueth it out of Bellarmin, writing <hi>that flesh and blood are not fit for meat vnles the beaſt</hi> (as Bel tranſlateth) <hi>dye or be ſlayne,</hi> Here Bel
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:11214:87"/> cold not imagin that Bellarmin ſpake of Chriſt (as in deed he doth not) vnles he think he called Chriſt a beaſt. But becauſe flesh and blood of beaſts are not fit for our meat before the beaſts be killed, he proueth by parity that Chriſts flesh and blood were not fit to be propoſed in manner of meat before he was ſacrifyced. And therupon ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth that he did Sacrifice him ſelfe at his laſt ſupper in an vnbloody manner, and after the order of Melchiſedech before he gaue his flesh, and blood as meat &amp; drinke to his Apoſtles. Which reaſon he tooke out of S. Gregory Niſſen: whoſe words shalbe <note place="margin">S. Gregor. Niſſen. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 1. de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectione.

               </p>
               <p>8. His fourth proofe is out of Bellarm: <note place="margin">Bellarm l. 1. de Miſſa. c. vltimo.</note> when he ſaith. <hi>That a true and real Sacrifice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth true and real killing quando in occiſione ponitur eſſentia ſacrificij,</hi> which Bel tranſlateth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bel pag.</hi> 22. <hi>Falſe tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation. vntruth</hi> 35.</note> thus <hi>Seing the eſſence of a Sacrifice conſiſteth in killing, which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the conſtant doctrin which S. Paule inculcateth to the hebrews:</hi> 9: <hi>v.</hi> 17. 25: 26. 27. 28. But this proofe relyeth onely vpon Bels falſe tranſlating the word <hi>Quando Seing</hi> which he should haue tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>when.</hi> And Bellarmins mynd is that the true Sacrifice requireth true killing,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:11214:87"/> when the eſſence therof conſiſteth in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as it doth in al bloody Sacrifices. But as for the Maſſe, he auoucheth it to be <hi>no</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Loc. iam cit.</note> 
                  <hi>Sacrifice but Sacriledge to ſay that Prieſts really kil Chriſt.</hi> And moſt falſe it is that S. Paul euer thought the eſſence of ſacrifice to conſiſt in killing. For beſide the vnbloody Sacrifice of Melchiſedech, he was not ignorant of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers vnbloody Sacrifices in the old law, as of incenſe, for which there was a ſpecial aultar, and of bread and wine. And in the places quoted by Bel he affirmeth that it was neceſſary for Chriſt to dye, &amp; by once dying to redeeme the world, which maketh nothing to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>9. Theſe proofs out of Bellarmin he <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bel pag.</hi> 23.</note> confirmeth by <hi>a conſtant poſition, and general receaued axiom</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>in the Popish</hi>

But Bellarm: telleth him that it is a far different thing, and that albeit Chriſts body and blood be ſeuerally conſecrated, yet they are not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated, nor one without the other in the Sacrament, becauſe as the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of Trent <note place="margin">Conc.

Firſt <hi>that Chriſt at his laſt ſupper was both ſitting at table, and borne in his own hands.</hi> But if this be abſurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, impious, and abſurd was S. Auſtin, <note place="margin">S. Auguſtin. ſerm. 1. in pſalm. 33.</note> when he ſaid that Chriſt at his laſt ſupper <hi>carried him ſelf in his hands ſecundum literam</hi> that is properly, <hi>and therin did more then any man can doe.</hi> But what abſurdity is it more, then for a body to be in twoe places? for that being once done, one may carry him ſelf as wel as an other. As the ſoule becauſe it is in al parts of the body, as it is in the legges carrieth it ſelfe as it is in the body. The ſecond abſurdity is <hi>that Chriſt at his laſt ſupper was both liuing and dead.</hi> But this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, for he was a liue in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though there he shewed no acts of life, and as long as he is a liue according to his natural being, he is neuer dead in the ſacrament, becauſe his ſacramental being is a memorial of his natural being repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and depending of it.</p>
               <p>2. The third abſurdity is <hi>that Chriſt was</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:11214:89" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>both viſible and inuiſible.</hi> Nether doth this follow. For though he were inuiſible in the Sacrament, yet it is not true to ſay abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely, he was inuiſible, becauſe he was there viſible in his proper forme.

The fourth abſurdity is, <hi>that Chriſt was at his ſupper long and short, broad and narrow, light and heauy.</hi> But rather theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, for what length bredth or weight Chriſt had in his proper forme, the ſame he had in the ſacrament, albeit it had not there the like effects of filling roome, or weighing; as nether he had when he was <note place="margin">

               <p>3. The fift is, <hi>that Chriſt was a ſacrifice for our ſins before he dyed for vs.</hi> This which Bel condemneth of impiety, we haue before proued it out of Scripture to be certayne verity, &amp; for ſuch the holy Fathers auouch it, let Bel heare one or twoe for al.

                  <hi>both the Prieſt, and the lamb of God. VVhen was this? when he gaue his body to be eaten and his blood to be drunk to his diſciples. For it is manifeſt to euery one, that man can not eate of a sheepe vnles ſlaughtering goe before eating. Seing therfore he gaue his diſciples his body to be eaten, he euidently shewed that the ſacrifizing was already perfect, and abſolute.</hi> S. Chriſoſtome alſo hom. de <note place="margin">S.

               <p>4. The Sixt and laſt abſurdity or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie which Bel inferreth is <hi>that al Christs ſacrifice at his ſupper was imperfect, or at his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion needles.</hi> But nether this followeth. For Chriſts ſacrifice at his ſupper was a moſt perfect vnbloodly ſacrifice according to the order of Melchiſedech, and yet his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice on the croſſe was needful, as the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culier price which God exacted at his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, for the redemption of the world, that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 15.</note> as the apoſtle ſaith, by death he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, who had the Empier of death. For albeit not only Chriſts whole body and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:11214:90"/> blood in the Euchariſt, but euen the leaſt drop of his blood, had been a ſufficient ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to redeeme the whole world: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles God, partly to shew his great hatred towards ſinne (wherof Chriſt bore the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: partly to manifeſt his infinite loue towards man kinde, for whoſe ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he would not ſpare the life of his only ſonne: partly for many other cauſes, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of Chriſt the ſuperaboundant price, and ranſome of his bloody ſacrifice on the croſſe. But let vs heare how Bel diſproueth this.</p>
               <p>5. He citeth fowre places out of S. Paule Heb 9. and 10. to proue that one oblation of the croſſe was ſufficient to take away al ſinns in the world, and that by it once made we are made holy, and after it once donne Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God. But what is this to the purpoſe. For we affirme not Chriſt to haue offered ſacrifice at his laſt ſupper, becauſe his ſacrifice on the Croſſe was not ſufficient, or we not made holy by it: but becauſe the ſcripture and fathers teach ſo, and Chriſt therby execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the function of his prieſthood, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the order of Melchiſedech, and applyed vnto his apoſtles the vertue of his bloody ſacrifice, as he applyeth it vnto vs by the dayly ſacrifice of the Maſſe: and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:11214:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> did not make perfect and conſummate his bloody ſacrifice, as Bel falſly chardgeth vs to thinke. As Bellarmin (whom onely I cite becauſe Bel accounteth his teſtimony moſt ſufficient) sheweth at lardge lib. 1. de Miſſa cap. 25. Wher alſo he anſwereth Bels arguments. But he should do wel to obiect the aforeſaid wordes of S. Paul againſt Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin blaſpheminge lib. 1. inſtit. 16. num. 8. &amp; 10. <hi>That nothinge had been done for vs if Chriſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Caluin. 2. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit. c. 16. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragr. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>had only ſuffered corporal death, but we needed a greater, and more excellent price.</hi> For this is plainly to ſay, that the oblation of Chriſts body once was not ſufficient, nor that Chriſt perfected al by one oblation, which is expreſly againſt S. Paule Hebr. 10. v. 10. <note place="margin">Hebr.</note> 12. 14. And thus much for Bels ſecond argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Maſſe.</p>

The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence we deny? for as the blood of calues, wher with the old teſtament was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, was both the peoples ſacrifice to God and his teſtament to them as appeareth Heb. 9. 20. and Exod. 24. v. 8. ſo Chriſts
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:11214:91" rendition="simple:additions"/> blood at his ſupper was both his ſacrifice to his father, and his teſtament to his apoſtles: And as a ſacrifice it tooke effecte imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, becauſe a ſacrifice is an abſolute gifte made to God, dependinge of no condition to come: as the ſacrifice of Abel and Noe <note place="margin">

               <p>10. But in deed the Apoſtle in the place cited by Bel, doth not ſo much deny an other oblation in ſubſtance, as an other ful and perfect partakinge of Chriſts oblation, teaching the Hebrues (as he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and as agayne in this Chapter v. 26.)

Out of which wordes Bel frameth an argument ſo inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible in his conceypt, as he promiſeth to ſubſcribe, and neuer more to write againſt any parte of Papiſts doctrine, if it be anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered. Marke therfore I pray thee gentle reader his argument, and my anſwer, and iudge, whether he be not bound to turne his coate the third tyme, if he wil performe his promiſe. The argument he propoſeth out of forme, but it may be reduced to this. Iudas receaued but <hi>Panem Domini</hi> the bread of our lord, and not <hi>Panem Dominum</hi> the bread our lord: therfore in the Euchariſt is not <hi>Dominus</hi> our Lord. The Antecedent (ſaith he) <hi>is playnly auouched by S.

Before I anſwer this argument I muſt aduertiſe the reader of three things: firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For if (as Bel noteth out of S. Auſtin) the bread which the Apoſtles eate was our lord, how can proteſtants deny it, and ſay it was bare bread? Or if (as S.

But here may the reader take a taſte of the vntrue dealing of heretiques. For who would not haue ſworne, but that Bel would haue dealt truely in an argument, wherof he counteth ſo much, as if it be ſolued, he wil recant the third tyme. But now to come to his argument.</p>
               <p>8. I anſwer directly by denying the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent. for S. Auſtin ſaid not, that Iudas eate <hi>but,</hi> or <hi>barely Panem Domini,</hi> bread of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:11214:99"/> our lord, and much les ſaid he eate not <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Dominum:</hi> but onely ſaid that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did eate <hi>Panem Dominum</hi> bread our lord, &amp; he <hi>Panem Domini</hi> bread of our lord. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the doubt can be onely why he altered his ſpeech, calling that bread our lord, which the Apoſtles eate, and that bread of our lord which Iudas eate. The reaſon wherof can not be, becauſe he thought the Apoſtles and Iudas receaued a bread of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſubſtance; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For as him ſelfe proueth lib. 11. cont. Fauſt. cap. 7. one thing of different effects or operations may haue different names. What maruaile then if he called that which the Apoſtles receaued bread our lord, becauſe it was both in ſubſtance and operation food, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:11214:99"/> life to them, and that which Iudas recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued bread of our lord, becauſe though in ſubſtance it was the ſame, yet through his malice, in operation it was poyſon and death vnto him And here by the way wold I propound one choiſe to Bel, whether he <note place="margin">A choiſe for Bel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> wil beleeue the Euchariſt to be <hi>Panem Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum</hi> with Catholiques, or bate <hi>Panem Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> with Proteſtants. If the firſt, he may eate <hi>Panem Dominum</hi> with the Apoſtles, if the ſecond, he may eate <hi>Panem Domini,</hi> but it shalbe with Iudas.</p>
               <p>9. But ſuppoſe S. Auſtin had ſaid (as he hath not) that Iudas did not eat bread our Lord, Bel could not therof infer that the Euchariſt is not truly our Lord, ſeing he auoucheth that the Apoſtles (who vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly receaued the Euchariſt) did eat bread our Lord: but at moſt, that what Iudas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, was not the Euchariſt; which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers think, and it is a far different queſtion, <note place="margin">S.

So lib. 11. cont. Fauſt. c. 7. he ſaith. <note place="margin">S. Auguſtin. tom. 6.</note> In reſurrection there shal be no flesh, and

Which kind of ſpeech he vſeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where, and proueth it out of 1. Cor. 15. and 2. cor. 5.

Let now euery indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Reader iudge whether this argument out of S.

But this maketh nothing againſt vs.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly I deny that to be ſuperior <note place="margin">Bel igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.</note> and inferior, is contradiction: for, as euery logician knoweth it is relatiue oppoſition, which may agree to the ſame thing in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reſpect. As the ſame ſoule as it is in the head, is locally ſuperior to it ſelfe, as it is in the foote; a man as he is learned, is inferior in valew to him ſelfe as he is vertuous: And a token as it is from a friend, more worth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is of it ſelfe. And hereby appeareth the error of Proteſtants inferring the Euchariſt not to be Chriſt, becauſe it is a figure or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance <note place="margin">One thing may figure or repreſent it ſelfe.</note> of him. For wel may one thing repreſent it ſelfe. As a King in a triumphant
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:11214:101" rendition="simple:additions"/> shew may repreſent, how he behaued him ſelfe in Battel. And Chriſts body and blood, as they are vnder the formes of bread and wyne, which are a ſunder, repreſent them ſelues as they were a ſunder in their proper formes on the croſſe.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly I returne Bels argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpon him ſelfe. Figures muſt needs be inferior to things figured: Ergo the Euchariſt is ſome nobler ſubſtance then bread. The Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is his owne, the Conſequence I proue, becauſe the Paſchal lambe was a figure of the Euchariſt as S. Chriſoſtom S. Cyprian S. <note place="margin">S.

               <p>4. His ſecond, and third contradiction is of a greater body being conteyned in a leſſe, and of Chriſts body broken, and not broken, which haue bene anſwered before. His fourth is, that <hi>if Chriſts body be made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Euchariſt by vertue of theſe words this is my body, ether the body is there before the laſt words be pronounced, or no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if before? then the laſt is ſuperfluous, if not? then ether al the body is</hi>

And likewiſe Luc. 16. prohibiteth mariage after diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a wife carnally known, as is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of Math. 5. v. 32. where he vſeth the ſame words, and citeth the law of diuorce Deut. 24. v. 1. which ſpeaketh of a woman carnally known ſaying. <hi>If a man haue taken a</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:11214:107"/>

Paul, in which he referreth him ſelf to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt. Beſids that S. Thecla virgin was by him <hi>ſoluta à nuptijs</hi> loſed from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage as writeth S. Epiph. haer. 78. which <note place="margin">S. Epiphan.</note> fact S.

Ambroſ.</note> and it argueth that the Apoſtle tought vnconſummated mariage might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued.</p>
               <p>6. Againſt this anſwer Bel bringeth many replies in number, but none of force. 1. <hi>That if contracted matrimony were not de iure</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 38.</note> 
                  <hi>diuino the greateſt Popish Doctors vvold not deny the Popes diſpenſation therin.</hi> Lo here when it maketh for his purpoſe, he confeſſeth the greateſt Catholique Doctors to think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted matrimony to be indiſſoluble. Why then doth he impugne the contrary as an Article of our faith? To his argument I anſwer, that though al Catholiques be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the inſtitution of contracted matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to be of God, and Deuines for the moſt part probably thinke the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance alſo therof to be <hi>iure diuino,</hi> and commanded by God: yet neuertheles Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts do probably teach that the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it is not abſolutly, and in al caſes commanded by God, but may vpon
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:11214:108" rendition="simple:additions"/> great, and vrgent cauſes be diſſolued by the Church.</p>
               <p>7. Secondly he replyeth that <hi>Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth abſolutly, and maketh no mention of copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or popish conſummation.</hi> Anſwer. Though in that verſe he ſpake abſolutly, yet imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly before he made mention of copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And wil Bel forbid vs to expound a ſentence of Scripture by the antecedents, or conſequents? But I maruel much why he tearmed conſummation, or copulation popish. Me thinketh he shold rather cal it Miniſterish. For Papiſts can ſay with S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin lib. de bono coniug. c. 13. tom. 6. <hi>VVe</hi>

               <p>8. His third reply is that <hi>Papiſts thinck matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony contracted to be a Sacrament ergo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>perfect before copulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; indiſpenſable by man. For as Canus ſaith: The holy Ghoſt and grace of</hi>

                  <hi>Sacrament is not giuen by copulation.</hi> Anſwer, graunting the Antecedent I deny the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. For though it haue the eſſence,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:11214:108" rendition="simple:additions"/> yet hath it not the perfection of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before copulation. Becauſe before, it ſignifyeth only the ſpiritual coniunction of Chriſt with a ſoule by grace, as S. Thomas, <note place="margin">S. Thom. 4. d. 27. q. 1. art. 3. q. 1. Innocent. 3. c. delictum de digamis.</note> and Innoc. 3. teach, which as it may by man be diſſolued, ſo alſo may matrimony before conſummation; but after, it ſignifieth alſo the coniunction of Chriſt to the Church by flesh, which as man can not diſſolue, ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he diſſolue matrimony after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation. And as a ſeal is the parfection of a bargain making it more hard to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken then otherwiſe it shold be: ſo copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is as it were the ſeal of the couenant of wedlock made betwixt man &amp; woman, &amp; maketh it more indiſſoluble then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it should be.</p>
               <p>9. As for Canus he meaneth of ſinful co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation betwixt perſons only affianced when <hi>they</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>after ſpouſals company together.</hi> But as for coniugal copulation after matrimony is contracted, if it be done in that manner and for that end it should be, it giueth grace, and is meritorius, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by S. Auſtin l. de bon. coniug. c. 21. 22. <note place="margin">See S. Auſtin l. 1. de nupt. &amp; concup. c. 12. 13. 14. 15. tom. 7.</note> tom. 6. where though he prefer the chaſtity of ſingle life before the chaſtity of mariage, yet he compareth Abrahams merit in his holy vſage of mariage with S. Ihons merit in liuing ſingle. Beſides lawful copulation
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:11214:109"/> is a good worke as I hope Bel wil not deny, but according to his owne doctrin art 5. <note place="margin">Artic. 5. p. 61.</note> euery good worke is meritorius or impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius of Gods fauor, &amp; reward. His fourh reply vz, that matrimony should not be fully perfected in the Church, if copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do perfect it, containeth no new diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
               <p>10. Fiftly he argueth it to be abſurd. That <hi>matrimony beginneth to be a Sacramant by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 39.</note>

                  <note place="margin">44 <hi>vntruth</hi>
                  </note> But more abſurd it is to vtter vntruths. For Catholiques ſay not that it beginneth to be <note place="margin">See Bellar. l. 2. de Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis. c. 38. <hi>The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus l.</hi> 8. <hi>de loc. c.</hi> 5.

His ſixt obiection is that <hi>Matrimony was perfect in Paradiſe betwixt Adam and Eue.</hi> But this is to aſſume that which he was to proue. His ſeuenth reply is: <hi>If contracted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony were not de iure diuino both parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing, they might diſſolue it them ſelues, as they can diſſolue ſpouſals, becauſe as the lavv ſaith euery one may yeeld vp his right.</hi> Anſwer. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted matrimony is a Sacrament inſtituted by God, and therfore can not be diſſolued but by ſuch as ſucceeding the Apoſtles are diſpenſers of Gods miſteries 1. Corinth. 4. <note place="margin">S. Paul.</note>

               <p>11. Eighthly he replyeth. That mariage betwene the B. virgin and Ioſeph was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, where doubtles wanted copulation. That it was perfect he proueth becauſe the <note place="margin">

                  <hi>but coniugal couenant maketh wedlock.</hi> And S. Auſtin writeth. That <hi>we rightly vnderſtand Ioſeph to be maries husband, by very copulation of wedlock without commixtion of flesh.</hi> Againe. <hi>God forbid that the bond of wedloock (rumpatur) be broken betwixt them, who are content vpon mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſent, to abſtein for euer from vſe of carnal concupiſcence. For it was not falſly ſaid of the Angel vnto Ioſeph, Fear not to take thy wife mary.</hi> Anſwer: Al theſe proofs conuince no more, then that contracted matrimony is true ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as we willingly confeſſe was betwixt Ioſeph and our B. Lady, For the Angel cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth her not Ioſephs perfect, wife, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly his wife. Wherupon S. Hierom l. <note place="margin">S.

Math. <hi>When thou hearest an husband do not ſuſpect mariage, but remember the custome of Scripture that ſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are called husbands, and ſpouſeſses wiſes.</hi> And S. Baſil hom. de human. Chriſ. gener. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <note place="margin">S. Baſil.</note> that diſpouſation wherwith S. Ioſeph,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:11214:110"/> and our Lady were maried, <hi>beginning of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> As for S. Ambroſe he denyeth not that deflowring perfecteth mariage, but that it maketh it. And S. Auſtin in the firſt place affirmeth that we truly vnderſtand Ioſeph to be Maries huſband without copulation, but addeth not that he is ſo perfectly.</p>
               <p>12. To the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d place I anſwer that S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin ſpeaketh there only of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſummated ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, both becauſe his intention in thoſe <note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 1.</note> books was as he profeſſeth in the beginning to shew againſt the Pelagians. That though childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> infected with original ſinne do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from mariage, it ſelfe is no ſinne, which difficulty hath no place but in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſummated mariage. As alſo becauſe after he had proued in the forſaid 11. chapter that the bond of wedlock is not broken by purpoſe of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteining from vſe (as he ſpeaketh) of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, or exerciſe of marigeable acts, in the next chapter he concludeth thus. <hi>VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>then may not they remain man and vvife, vvho of conſent leaue of companying together, if Ioſeph and mary remayned man, and vvife, vvho not ſo much as began to company together.</hi> By which Concluſion of his, it is euident that before he had ſpoken only of conſummated ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and only meant to proue that it is not broken by priuate determination, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the parties to abſteine from exerciſe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:11214:110"/> of copulation. Which he proued by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <hi>a fortiori,</hi> becauſe vnconſummated matrimony of our B. Lady, and Ioſeph was not broken by their purpoſe of abſteining from al carnal knowledge. But whither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſummated matrimony which is not broken by ſuch priuate purpoſes of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties maried, may vpon iuſt and vrgent cauſe be diſſolued by the Churches authority S. Auſtin there ſaith no word at al.</p>
               <p>13. Finally Bel concludeth this Article with an egregious ſlaunder of the Pope, and falſe dealing with S. Antonin. For he auoucheth that <hi>P. Martin</hi> 5. <hi>diſpenſed with one</hi>

               <p>5. Fourth Concluſion: whenſoeuer it is any way voluntary ether in it ſelf, or in any needles cauſe therof, it is formally ſinne. This is euident: becauſe then it hath
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:11214:113" rendition="simple:additions"/> the whole eſſence or definition of ſinne: for it is a voluntary act againſt Gods law, or right reaſon.

For ether it is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, and then it is formal ſinne, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called: or though it be vn volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, it is the cauſe, effect, punishment, or material part of ſinne: and any of theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſuffice to make it figuratiuely be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſinne. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And they al are taken out of S.

For 1. de nupt. &amp; concup. c. 23. he ſaith Concupiſcence may be called ſinne, becauſe it is the effect of ſinne, as writing is called a hand. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And in the ſame place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the cauſe of ſinne: as coldnes is called ſluggish becauſe it maketh ſluggish. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Likwiſe 1.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:11214:114" rendition="simple:additions"/> therfore may as wel be called ſinne as a dead body is called a man.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence if inuolun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary is no formal ſinne.</note> whenſoeuer it is inuoluntary is no formal or proper ſinne, or offence to God. This is againſt Bel in this whole Article. But I proue it. Firſt becauſe ſome acts of Concupiſcence be but temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to ſinne, and are before ſinne be brought forth. Ergo ſuch are no formal ſinne. The conſequence is euident. For what is but tentation to ſinne, and goeth before ſinne be, is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſinne. The Antecedent I proue out of S.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:11214:114" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſinne may bring forth an other: but we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that that act of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcence, which S.

               <p>8. Secondly becauſe whiles a man with the minde ſerueth the law of God he can not by ſinne ſerue the dyuel. But S. Paul euen when he had inuoluntary motions of concupiſcence, ſerued with the minde the law of God. Therfore then he ſinned not. The Propoſition is euident by the ſaying <note place="margin">S.

               </p>
               <p>9. Thirdly nothing inuoluntary, or done againſt our wil is ſinne, diuers acts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence be ſuch. Ergo no ſinne. Bel <note place="margin">

               <p>10.

But Bel is ignorant <note place="margin">VVhat is to be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in the origen.</note> what it is to be voluntary in the origen. For this is nothing els but to be willed of him, from whom we took our origin, and whoſe wil is accounted ours. As original ſinne is voluntary to infants in their origin, becauſe it was willed of Adam in the eating of the forbidden Aple, and his wil was in that fact accounted theirs. And this ment S. Auſtin loc. cit. But as for actual motions <note place="margin">1. Retract. c. 13. to. 1.</note> of concupiſcence, he neuer ſaid they were voluntaty to vs in their origin; nether can <note place="margin">
                     <hi>VVhy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoluntary motions are not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen.</hi> S. Gregory.</note> they both becauſe Adam had no wil of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Beſides as S. Gregory writeth l. 15. moral. c. 22. <hi>Original ſinne being blotted out, children are not held by the iniquity of</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:11214:116"/> 
                  <hi>parents,</hi> and therfore Adams wil, can not make thoſe acts in the regenerate to be ſinne, which of their nature are none.</p>
               <p>12. And though the forſaid motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were <note place="margin">Inuolunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motions though they vvere vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary in their origen could be no ſinne.</note> voluntary in their origen, yet could they be nether, original, nor actual ſinne. Not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, becauſe they are acts, and not com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon alike to al: Nor actual, becauſe they haue no actual wil of the doer, and as vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary in general is eſſential to ſinne in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ſo is actual voluntary, to actual ſinne. Yea for an act now done to be formal ſinne when it is done, ſufficeth not, that it was actually voluntary in the cauſe done long ago, if now it be againſt wil. For albeit when I gaue cauſe of an vnlawful effect, which I did ſee wold after enſue, I was guilty of the effect, when I did the cauſe: yet if after the cauſe done I repent &amp; be ſory before the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect follow, I do not ſinne a new in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. As if by ſome thing yeſterday done, I gaue occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that diſordinate motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s riſe to day, though I was then guilty of theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions riſing, yet if I ſince repented I do not ſinne a new when they riſe now againſt my wil. Els I should againſt my wil leeſe that grace which I got by repentance. Wherfore wel wrote S. Gregory to S. Auſtin our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. <note place="margin">S.

Firſt becauſe if it be any ſinne, it is original (for actual it can not be, being no act) but original it is not, becauſe by regeneration, <hi>vve put of the old man.</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſ. 3. v. 9. or lay away the old man Epheſ. 4. verſic. 22. and <hi>put on the nevv:</hi> Coloſſ. 3. v. 9. and Epheſ. 4. v. 24. And by keeping original ſinne we keep on the old man as by firſt contracting it we put him on. But it is contradiction at the ſame tyme to keep on, and put of or lay away the old man. Ergo in our regeneration we keep not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſinne. And this is confirmed: becauſe by ſinne we bear the image of the earthly man, by regeneration the image of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly according to that 1. Corinth. 15. v. 49. <hi>As vve haue borne the image of the earthly</hi> (man) <hi>let vs bear alſo the image of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly.</hi> But theſe two images be oppoſit.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:11214:118" rendition="simple:additions"/> can not haue damnable ſinne, as original ſinne is, and be regenerate.</p>
               <p>15. Secondly in regeneration either we remaine guilty of damnable ſinne, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guiltles of al ſuch ſinne. If we remaine guilty, then is not our ſinne forgiuen: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that article of our Creed. <hi>Forgiuenes</hi>

For as the Philoſopher ſaith <hi>bonum ex integra canſa, malum ex quolibet defectu.</hi> It is no good act vnles it be good euery way, and it is ſinne if it be euil any way.</p>
               <p>6. As for fulfilling the law: I anſwer that who conſenteth not to Concupiſcence fulfilleth it in al things which it comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to be performed vnder ſinne as S.

Auſtin ſerm. 4. de verb. Apoſt. c. 4. &amp; 5. to. 10.</note> with a new kinde of philoſophy taught vs that habits are acts, and inclinations actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But to the argument I deny the aſſumption. For he might be ignorant that luſt which <note place="margin">Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary knovvne of S Paul by the lavv to be ſinne.</note> is only indirectly voluntary, and in the cauſe, becauſe it is not preuented, is ſinne, and this he might know by the law: nether can Bel shew that euer any heathen knew this. Yea he might be ignorant, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence directly voluntary, when it is not put in execution, is true ſinne &amp; learne this by the law. For if Ioſephus, and Kimhi <note place="margin">Ioſephus l. 12. Antiquit. c. 12. Kimhi in pſal. 66.</note> though they had the law, and were great Rabbins in it, yet thought ſuch concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence no ſinne: and Ioſephus reprehended Polybius for condemning it as a ſinne; why might not the Apoſtle haue bene ignorant of this, if the law had not taught it him. Neither doth Bels reaſon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For though ſome Heathen by great ſtudy in moral philoſophy came to know this truth, yet perhaps S. Paul could not or rather as he ſaieth did not. And Bel as we
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:11214:130"/> shal ſee hereafter citeth a place out of S. Am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bros where he writeth, that the Apoſtle <note place="margin">S. Ambroſ. in cap. 7. ad Rom.</note> thought Concupiſcence no ſinne <hi>becauſe it delighted, and ſeemed a harmles thing to couet.</hi> yet better it is to ſay: (as I haue already) that S. Paul meaneth, that by the law he came to know al voluntary concupiſcence, though it be but indirectly voluntary, to be ſinne, and this nether he nor any Heathen could haue known, but by the law, or by Gods reuelation.</p>
               <p>10. Bels ſecond reaſon maketh againſt him ſelf. For if inuoluntary motions be as true ſinnes as voluntary, why are not they forbidden as wel in the ſixt, ſeuenth, and eighth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement as theſe? And albeit voluntary motions were implicitly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, when the external acts were prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet it was neceſſary to forbid them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in the laſt commandement for to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcat it into the hard hartes of the Iewes: nether yet with this expreſſe forbiddance wold ſome of them beleeue voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence without the fact to be ſinne, as appeareth by the example of Ioſephus Kimhi, and diuers Iewes, Math. 5. v. 29. After this Bel alleadgeth a place of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin wher he calleth deſires of Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence il, filthy, and not lawful, which haue bene explicated before, and are verifyed of <note place="margin">Chapt. 1. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag. 2. &amp; 3.</note>

               <p>2. The firſt is of S. Ambroſe in. c. 7. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bel pag.</hi> 56. S. Ambroſ.</note> Rom. where he ſaith that <hi>a man is not free from cryme, becauſe he ſinneth inuitus vnwillin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly or againſt his wil.</hi> Where Bel noteth that he calleth concupiſcence cryme, or mortal
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:11214:132"/> ſinne. And, That a man ſinneth in that which he doth againſt his wil. But beſides that the Author of thoſe commentaries is not S. Ambroſe: he meaneth not of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence but of cuſtome of ſinning, which begun in the ſinner (ſaith he) <hi>by his owne fault, and ſloath, and wherby he is laded and ſooner yeeldeth to ſinne then to the law, and though he wold do good, yet is he oppreſsed by cuſtome.</hi> And therfore when he ſaith that ſuch a one is not free from cryme in ſinning againſt his wil, he meaneth not of abſolute, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute wil to the contrary (for cuſtome can not make a man to do a thing againſt his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute wil, but of an imperfect wil which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers cal velleity, which moſt ſinners, though neuer ſo accuſtomed to ſinne, haue to do good, and againſt which kind of wil they ſinne: but are not therfore (as that Author ſaith truly free from cryme, becauſe (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this imperfect wil of doing wel) they haue an abſolute and perfect wil to ſinne. And ſo this place concerneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing acts of concupiſcence altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoluntary and againſt both perfect, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect wil.</p>
               <p>3. An other teſtimony he citeth out of S. Ambroſe in the ſame place where he ſaith. <hi>That S. Paul ſeparated not this concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence from ſinne, but mingled it.</hi> But he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:11214:132" rendition="simple:additions"/> only of voluntary acts, as is euident by the reaſon, wherwith he proueth that this concupiſcence ſeemed no ſinne, <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it delighted, and ſeemed ſimplex cauſa, a harmles matter to couet a thing of our neighbour.</hi>
               </p>

Bel allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth him becauſe he ſaith. <hi>They ſinne who of frailty (lat: infirmitas) corrupt innocency.</hi> What is here to the purpoſe? who deny that ſinne may be done as wel of frailty, as of malice?

                  <hi>are the true effects of Predestination.</hi> This if it be ſo meant, that al, and only predeſtinate do good works, is moſt falſe: for many infants are predeſtinat, and yet dye before they do good works, and many reprobate men do good works, as appeareth by Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus who beleeued, and cleued to S.

And to theſe queſtions I wil anſwer by the Concluſions enſuing.</p>
               <p>2. Firſt Concluſion: There is merit of eternal life, and our ſupernatural works done by Gods grace (wherof only we ſpeak in this matter) are meritorious of eternal life, and glory. This is a point of faith with Catholiques, defyned in the Councel of Trent. ſeſſ. 6. can 32. and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed <note place="margin">Concil.

               <p>4. Second Concluſion. Good workes done in Gods grace are condignely merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of eternal life. This is that which Bel impugneth in this Article as a point of our faith and auoucheth it to be defyned by the Councel of Trent but falſly. For the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel hath no word of condigne merit but only of true merit which in plaine tearms Bel him ſelf dare not impugne or deny. <hi>If any shal ſay</hi> (ſaith the Councel) <hi>that a iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>

And Bellarmin whome Bel tearmeth the mouth of Papiſts, lib. 5. de iuſtific. cap. 16. after he had rehearſed twoe opinions of Catholiques, wherof the one ſeemeth plainly to deny condigne merit, the other admitteth it only in a large ſenſe, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and defendeth the third opinion which defendeth condigne merit abſolutly, only as <hi>veriſsimam &amp; communem ſententiam Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorum,</hi> moſt true and the common opinion of Diuines as indeed it is and we shal proue it anone againſt Bel. Hereby appeareth Bels shameful proceeding in this Article, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning condigne merit as a point of faith defyned by the Councel of Trent, which hath no word of condigne merit, and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the queſtion of true merit which the

               <p>5. The third Concluſion is: that This <note place="margin">

This is held of the beſt Diuines and proued at large by Bellarmin. l. 5 de iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifi. c. 14. The fourth Concluſion is that This condigne merit in our works, is not perfect, hauing actual, and perfect arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical equality before explicated: This mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly <note place="margin">S. Auguſt. in pſal. 93. to. 8. S. Chryſoſt. 2. Cor. 9. S. Bernard. ſerm 1. de Annuntiat.</note> the Fathers teach with al Catholiques, and Bels arguments hereafter brought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince it, and no more. The fifte Concluſion is that the imperfect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>digne merit which is in our works to heauen, riſeth not meerly of Gods acceptation, but partly of the due proportion, and ſufficiency before explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in them to the reward. This likewiſe is no matter of faith, yet truth taught by S. Thomas 1. 2. 4. 114. ar. 1. &amp; 3. Bonauent. <note place="margin">S. Thomas. S.

Our Sauiour calleth it a <hi>rewarde,</hi> and ſaith we <hi>get it by violence.</hi> S. Ihon according to S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins expoſition calleth it grace for grace, that is, grace of glory not abſolutly, but for grace of merits, or grace mixt with iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. S.

Bel, and leaue theſe ſame nouelties of wordes.</p>
               <p>8. Likewiſe it is not iniurious to Chriſts merits but rather honourable to them. For as it is not iniurious to Gods doing good, that we by his grace do good for our ſelfs, but rather honourable according to our

What iniury is it to the tree that the branch thereof bringeth forth fruit: nether are we therfore more partners with Chriſt in merit, then we are by prayers partners with him in impetration.</p>
               <p>9. That our merits haue proportion, <note place="margin">Merits haue proportion to glory.</note> and vertual equality to their reward follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth alſo out of the former. For condigne merit requireth at leſt due proportion to the reward, but eſpecially I proue it. Firſt becauſe the reward conſiſteth in the cleare ſight of God face to face, and in perfect loue of him, and our merit conſiſteth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in faith which is a ſight, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in a glaſſe, and in louing him aboue al things. But there is due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the ſight of a thinge in a glaſſe, and the cleare ſight thereof, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt perfect loue, and the loue aboue al things: Ergo: Secondly good workes are fruits of the holy Ghoſt. Galat. 5. v. 22. and of Chriſts paſſion: for by it we do theſe
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:11214:146" rendition="simple:additions"/> good workes. Ergo it is iniury to the holy Ghoſt, and to Chriſt to ſay that their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural fruits haue no proportion to a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural rewarde. Thirdly glory is grace: Rom. 6. Ioan. 1. and our merits are grace, but there is proportion between two gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: 4. Grace is the ſeed of glory accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that 1. Ioan. 3. <hi>The ſeed of God remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in him,</hi> therfore in vertue it conteineth glory as the ſeed doth the tree: 5. Glory is a floode making glad the citty of God pſal. 45. and grace is a fountaine of water lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into eternal life. Ioan. 4. but there is proportion between a floode and a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine which ſpringeth into the place of the floode. Now let vs come to Bels argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which beſide that they impugne no matter of faith as is before ſaid, they diſproue no ſuch condignity of merit as Catholiques teach, and is already explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but ſuch as is both abſolute, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly equal to the rewarde. And at laſt after he had runne him ſelfe out of breath, confeſſeth that he can not impugne condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne merit as it is defended by Bellarmin, who in truth teacheth no other herein then is the common doctrine of the Church.</p>

This is great in ſome, in others les, in others none at al, but moſtful charity, which can be no more encreaſed, is in none, whiles a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyueth here, but whiles it may be encreaſed ſurely that vvhich is les then it should be, is ex vitio, of vice.</hi> (Bel tranſlateth ſinne) <hi>by reaſon of vvhich vice thereis no iuſt on earth, which doth good, and ſinneth not: by reaſon of</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:11214:153"/> 
                  <hi>which vice no liuing man shal be iuſtifyed in Gods ſight.

               </p>
               <p>2. Hence Bel gathereth 1. <hi>That S. Austin</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 67. <hi>vntruth</hi> 61</note> 
                  <hi>ſaith that no man can haue charity in that perfect degree which the lavv requireth.</hi> This is vntrue: for he only ſaith, that no man hath in this life that moſt ful charity, which can not be encreaſed. 2. <hi>That the want therof proceedeth of vice.</hi> This is true, but of what kinde of vice he meant, him ſelfe had explicated a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the ſame place: ſaying: <hi>VVho therfore is without ſome vice, that is without ſome fomite, or as a roote of ſinne.</hi> Wherfore he meant not that the want of moſt ful charity procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of formal ſinne, but of that which is cauſe, and roote of ſinne, to wit, concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. And by this are anſwered al the reſt of Bels notes out of this place. As that by reaſon of this vice euery man is a ſinner, none iuſtified before God, if we ſay we haue no ſinne we be lyers, we haue need to aske God forgiuenes euen after baptiſme. For al theſe things are verifyed of Concupiſcence, not formally but effectiuely, that is, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence (which S. Auſtin calleth vice,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:11214:153" rendition="simple:additions"/> becauſe it is the roote, and cauſe of formal vice) cauſeth ſinne in vs, which ſinne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs formally ſinners, not iuſtifyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and to neede forgiuenes euen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter baptiſme. And hereby are explicated <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bel pag.</hi> 68.</note> the like words of S. Ambroſe which <note place="margin">S.

Ihon ſaith. If we ſay we haue no ſinne we ſeduce our ſelfs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. But ſuppoſe that S. Auſtin had ſaid al <note place="margin">Bel forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his matter.</note> that Bel inferreth, though it would proue Concupiſcence to be formal ſinne, yet would it not proue that our workes are no condigne merit, which is the queſtion now in hand. For though Concupiſcence were as Bel rhinketh venial ſinne, which he art. 9. calleth ſinne not regnant, yet might other ſupernatural works of ours, as faith, hope, and charity be condigne merit. But Bel careth not how he ſpeaketh to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo he ſay ſomwhat: Euen ſo in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Article when he should proue Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence to be ſinne, he proued our merits to be none, and now when he should proue our merit to be none he proueth Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence <note place="margin">

                  <hi>iuſtice of faith is imperfect.</hi> Ergo ſaith Bel there is no condigne merit. wheras he should
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:11214:154" rendition="simple:additions"/> haue inferred the quite contrary. For if in vs there be imperfect iuſtice, there is iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and if there be iuſtice, there is condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne merit to that whereto we haue iuſtice. And the moſt that Bel could inferre for him ſelfe, is that there is no perfect condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne merit, which I willingly graunt: Albeit indeed S. Auſtin in that place calleth not our iuſtice imperfect, becauſe there is any thing wanting to it ſelfe, which is requiſit to iuſtice, for epiſt. 105. he calleth it true iuſtice, but becauſe we, who haue it, <hi>delight</hi>

Suppoſing therfore that ſome ſinnes <note place="margin">Mortal and venal ſinnes are ſuch of their ovvne nature.</note> are mortal, and others venial, I intend to proue by Scripture, Fathers, and reaſon, that they are ſuch of their owne nature. The Scripture compareth ſuch ſinnes as are mortal, and venial to things, which of their owne nature are different as Math. 23. to a <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>Luc.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 42.</note> Camel, and a gnat. Luc. 6. to a ſtrawe, and a beame: Ergo: theſe kinde of ſinnes are different of their owne nature. Likewiſe our Sauiour Luc. 12. 58. compareth ſome <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 27.</note> ſinnes to mites or farthings, which of their nature are ſmal debts. Moreouer God hath no where reuealed that ſome kinde of ſins become venial only by his mercy. Therfore we ought not to ſay ſo. The Conſequence is euident. for none knoweth the pleaſure of God but by his reuelation. The Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent I proue: for Proteſtants can neither name the ſinnes, which God hath made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, nor the place, where God hath reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led any ſuch making of his. Bel citeth Math. 12. v. 3. where it is ſaid, that <hi>VVe shal giue account of euery idle word.</hi> And 1. Iohn. 3. v. 4. where ſinne is called iniquity. But in neither place it is ſaid that Gods mercy maketh any ſinne venial, and other like places cited by other Proteſtants rather proue that al ſinnes notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding Gods mercy are now mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, then that any, which of them ſelfe were
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:11214:165"/> mortal, became venial by his mercy. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for venial ſinne he nameth ſinne not regnant, wherby he vnderſtandeth inuolun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary motions of concupiſcence. But for ſuch inuoluntary motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (which Bel rightly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <note place="margin">Bels beleefe of venial ſinnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fydes Gods booke.</note> not regnant ſinne, but wrongly venial) nether are they any true ſinne as venial ſinne is; nor is it any where reuealed, that they being of their nature mortal ſins, are made venial only through Gods mercy.

If it change it nature, then a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ter Gods mercy, of it nature it is venial, and Gods mercy is only the cauſe of changing the nature of it. If it retaine the ſelfe ſame nature, how is it poſſible, but God if he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it truly, according to truth (as al his iudgements are. Rom. 2. v. 2.) should not account of it as a mortal ſinne, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing hel. Wherfore what Proteſtants talke of ſome ſinnes becomming venial, or no ſinnes at al, by Gods meere not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them for ſinnes, without any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſinnes them ſelfs, is meere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and contrary to S. Auſtin, and reaſon as is shewed in the fourth Article. c. 3. parag. 4.</p>
               <p>5. Againe: infidels haue venial ſinnes. Ergo venial ſins become not ſuch only by Gods meere not imputing them for mortal. The conſequence is cleare out of the Proteſtants doctrine, who put that <hi>not imputing</hi> only <note place="margin">VVillet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trac. 17. part. 3. p. 560.</note> towards the faithful &amp; regenerate.

                  <hi>in incredulity.</hi> And I aske of Bel why God maketh ſinne not regnant, venial, rather then regnant, and either he muſt ſay that God doth it without any cauſe, or becauſe they are inuoluntary and theſe voluntary, which is to ſay, that by their different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they are made mortal, and venial.</p>
               <p>6. Finally ſome ſinnes of their nature breake frendship with God, and deſerue his eternal hatred, and punishment. others do not. Ergo: ſome of their nature are mortal others venial. The conſequence is euident: The Antecedent I proue: becauſe he is no wiſe perſon, who wil fal out, and be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for euer with his friend for euery trifle, as the taking vp of a ſtraw: nor he is a iuſt Prince, who should inflict death for ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a pinne: &amp; I beleeue Bel would thinke him ſelfe vniuſtly ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled if he were ſo dealt withal. Wherfore if God should do this we
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:11214:166" rendition="simple:additions"/> should neither account him a wiſe friend, nor a iuſt Prince. Now let vs heare what Bel obiecteth againſt this ſo manifeſt truth.</p>

               <p>8. To this argument Catholiques an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer differently, ſome by denyal of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:11214:167" rendition="simple:additions"/> others by denial of the Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some ſay that euery ſinne which is againſt the Law is not mortal, but only that which is perfectly againſt it, ſo that it deſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roleth the end of the law, which is Charity &amp; this venial ſinnes do not. And if I should anſwer thus, Bel were by and by at a Non plus. Others ſay that venial ſinnes are not againſt the law, becauſe they are not againſt the end of the law, but beſides the law. But this difference is rather in words then in matter, al agreeing that venial ſinne deſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roieth not Charity nor breaketh friendship <note place="margin">1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 5.</note> with God, which is the end for which the law was made. Yet better it is to ſay, that venial ſinnes are beſide the law, then againſt <note place="margin">VVhy ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſinnes are not againſt the lavv.</note> the law: becauſe what is not contrary to the end, but may ſtand with out breach of it, is not contrary to the meanes, but may ſtand without breach of them, but venial ſinnes are not contrary to Charity the end of the law: but may be without breach of it. Ergo neither are they contrary to the law, but may be without breach of it. And as a man trauailing, though he ſteppe out of his way is not ſaid to goe contrary to his iourneys end: ſo a man walking to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though by venial ſin he ſteppe out, or beſides the way, yet doth he not goe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary way to hel: The Propoſition of myne argument is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:

For venial ſins (whence ſoeuer they come to be ſuch) breake not friendship with God. And therfore if Bel graunt in deed (as he doth in words) that by Gods mercy ſome ſins are made venial, he muſt alſo confeſſe that by Gods mercy, they are not againſt his Charity, and friendship: and ſo muſt anſwer his owne argument, which indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently proueth that there are no venial ſins at al, whither they be ſaid to be ſuch by their owne nature, or by Gods mercy: for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument aſſumeth not that al which is ſinne of it owne nature is againſt Gods law, but abſolutly, al which is ſinne is againſt Gods law.

Catholiques anſwer twoe waies. Firſt that S, Ihon in this place by ſinne vnderſtandeth only ſuch ſinne as c. 5. v. 16. he calleth <hi>ſinne to death</hi> vz. mortal
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:11214:168"/> ſinne. And this I proue: Firſt becauſe in the next verſe but one vz. v. 6. he ſpeaketh only of mortal ſinne, when he ſaith. <hi>Euery one that remaineth in him</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>ſinneth not,</hi> and v. 8. <hi>who doth ſinne is of the Diuel,</hi> and v. 9. <hi>Euery one that is borne of God committeth not ſinne, becauſe his ſeede remaineth in him.</hi> In theſe verſes it is euident S. Ihon ſpake only of <hi>ſome certeine kinde of ſinne which</hi> (as S. Auſtin <note place="margin">S. Auſtin.</note> tract: 5. in 1. Iohn tom. 9. ſaith) <hi>one borne of God can not commit,</hi> vz. of mortal ſinne: wherfore of the ſame did he meane. v. 4. when he in ſome ſorte deſcribed ſinne by i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity. Both becauſe els it should ſeeme a kinde of equiuocation, as alſo becauſe if he had deſcribed ſinne in general, it is likely he would haue afterward diſcourſed of the ſame, and not of one only kind of ſinne. Secondly becauſe when a worde principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifyeth one thing, it is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to an other, which ſecondarily it ſignifieth, vnles ſuch extention be gathered by ſome circumſtances of the ſpeech, ſeeing therfore the worde Sinne doth principally ſignify only mortal ſinne, and ſecondarily venial ſinne, according to S. Thomas. 1. 2. <note place="margin">S. Thomas.</note> 4. 88. ar. 1. &amp; there is no circumſtance here conuincing it to be extended to ſignify ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſinne, but rather to the contrarie as hath bene shewed, it is not to be extended
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:11214:169" rendition="simple:additions"/> to venial ſinne. And this is confirmed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Scriptures Fathers, and Catholicke writers by Sinne vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ordinarily only mortal ſinne, as appeareth by their attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of death, loſſe of grace, and heauen, guilt of hel, ſeperation from God, and the like to Sinne, and by defyning it to be againſt Gods law, or tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſion of the law: which agree only to mortal ſinne.</p>
               <p>2. Thirdly becauſe S. Bede vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">S. Beda 1. Io. 3.</note> it of ſuch ſinne, as either is of conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of the written law, or corrupteth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of the law of nature. And the glof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ord. followeth his very words: alſo gloſ. interlin. vnderſtandeth it of ſinne contrary to equity of Gods law: which he tooke of S. Bede loc. cit. Lyra expresſly expowndeth <note place="margin">Lyra 1. Io. 3.</note> it of mortal ſinne, and defyneth it to be tranſgreſſion of the law. and the ſame doth Carthuſia: and to this purpoſe ſerue al Bels proofs, that <hi>anomia</hi> ſignifyeth tranſgreſſion of the law: for if that be ſo, then ſinne is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for mortal ſinne. Nether againſt this expoſition ſee I any obiection, more then that the worde Sinne may ſignify venial ſinne, and that alſo it is taken for it c. 1. v. 8. where he ſaith <hi>If we ſay we haue no ſinne we deceaue our ſelfs.</hi> But we may anſwer that, though it may ſignify venial ſinne yet ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily it doth not, and therfore it is not wel
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:11214:169"/> inferred, that here it doth, eſpecially ſeeing that there are diuers circumſtances to the contrary. And though it ſignify ſinne in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral c. 1. v. 8 yet ſeeing it doth ſignify only mortal in this ſame chapter. v. 6. 8. and 9. better it is to gather the ſignification of a worde out of the next vſe therof, then out of the further of. And if one wil thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pownd the place of S. Ihon (as to me it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <note place="margin">S. Ihon mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth onely of mortal ſinne.</note> beſt) Bel were ſtraight at a Non plus. For he ſuppoſeth that the worde ſinne is taken for al kinde of ſinne, and only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that the worde <hi>anomia iniquity</hi> is taken for perfect ſinne, and tranſgreſſion. yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I wil giue him al the ſcoape he can aske, I admit that by Sinne S. Ihon vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood al kinde of actual ſinne, and deny (as many Catholicks do) that <hi>anomia Iniquity</hi> is taken for wickednes, and perfect tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the law: but generally as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to perfect tranſgreſſion, and only ſwaruing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the law. Now let vs ſee how Bel improueth this.</p>
               <p>3. His firſt proofe is becauſe Arias Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus <note place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 52. Arias Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. 1. Io. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> ſaith, that <hi>anomia</hi> is tranſgreſſion of the law. But this is not againſt vs, becauſe we graunt that it may ſignify ſo, only we deny that to be the proper ſignification of the worde, as is euident by the etimology therof, which is as much as <hi>ſine lege</hi> without
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:11214:170" rendition="simple:additions"/> the law, and not <hi>contra legem:</hi> againſt the law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet becauſe al acts againſt law are alſo without law, the worde may be vſed for acts againſt law, and ſo ſignify tranſgreſſion of the law. It ſufficeth vs that the propriety of the worde is for vs not for Bel, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we better expownd it of ſwaruing from the law, then Bel or any other doth of tranſgreſſion of the law.</p>
               <p>4. His ſecond proofe is that S. Ambros <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bel pag.</hi> 53. S. Ambroſ. S. Auſtin.</note> de Parad. c. 8. and S. Auſtin l. 2. de conſen. euang. c. 4. and l. 22. cont. Fauſt. c. 27. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyne ſinne to be preuarication, or tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the law, or to be a thought, worde or deede againſt the eternal law, which (ſaith S. Auſtin) is deuine reaſon, or the wil of God comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the order of nature to be kept, and forbidding it to be broken. But theſe, Fathers define only mortal ſinne; becauſe Catholicks ordinarily vnderſtand only that ſinne, when they abſolutly ſpeake of ſinne, as men, when they ſpeake of a thinge meane of ſubſtance. As alſo becauſe S. Ambros had before ſpoken only of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſinne vz. of Adam, and Iudas his ſinne. And S. Auſtin in the firſt place ſpeaketh of ſinne againſt the tenne commandements, which no doubt is of it nature mortal, and in the ſecond place he plainly defineth ſuch ſinne, as breaketh the order of nature, which
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:11214:170" rendition="simple:additions"/> alſo is mortal ſinne not venial; for who wil ſay that a litle ſuperfluous laughter breaketh the order of nature. Beſides it followeth not that if S. Ambros, and S. Auſtin defined ſinne to be tranſgreſſion of the law, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. Ihon did ſo cal it in this place.</p>
               <p>5. His third proofe is out of S. Bede. But <note place="margin">S. Bed. 1. Io. 3.</note> he is rather againſt him. For he ſaith that <hi>anomia</hi> ſignifieth <hi>quaſi contra legem vel ſine lege factum:</hi> as it were againſt law or without law. He ſaith not againſt, but as it were againſt, which more plainly he explicateth ſaying. <hi>Or without the law.</hi> Lyra, and Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia: whom he citeth ſeeme by <hi>anomia,</hi> and iniquity to vnderſtand wickednes, but then by ſinne they vnderſtand only mortal ſinne, and ſo fauour Bel nothing. But becauſe the <note place="margin">

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:11214:171"/> not whether <hi>anomia,</hi> and <hi>adicia</hi> be al one. Better therfore he replieth afterward pag, 58. where he proueth <hi>anomia.</hi> and <hi>adicia</hi> to be al one, becauſe the vulgar latine tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them both <hi>Iniquitas.</hi> But the Rhemiſts anſwere, That the worde <hi>Iniquitas</hi> is vſed in a different ſignification, and proue it by the different greeke words, for which it is vſed; And againſt this Bel ſaith nothing, But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a non plus him ſelfe, and not able to reply againſt this anſwer, and reaſon, he cryeth out that <hi>his anſvverer is at a non plus, &amp; impudently denyeth euery iniquity? to be ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. But as for the Rhemiſts, euident it is that herein they are neither impudent, nor at a <hi>Non plus,</hi> ſeeing they giue a reaſon of what they ſay, againſt which Bel can not reply; And as for iniquity and ſinne, though <note place="margin">Pſalm. 50. 118. &amp; alibi ſup.</note> they be oftentymes confounded both by Scriptures, &amp; Fathers, yet if we wil ſpeake exactly and properly, more is required to formal, and proper ſinne, then to formal iniquity. For iniquity requireth only want <note place="margin">Difference betvvixt formal ſinne and iniquity.</note> of equity, and conformity to Gods law. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſinne beſides this requireth voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; ſo al formal ſinne is formal iniquity but not contrarywiſe. As adultery or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der committed by a foole or mad man is ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, but no more ſinne then it is in beaſts. Hereupon S. Auſtin l. 2. contr.

Albeit when he ſaith, that al iniquity is blotted out in baptiſme, he confounde iniquity with ſinne, as before is cited out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which argueth that wel may the worde iniquity be taken in a different ſenſe Iohn. 5. and 3. as Iohn 5. for voluntary ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and proper ſinne, as appeareth by the greeke worde <hi>adicia,</hi> and c. 3. for iniquity in general, as appeareth by the worde <hi>anomia,</hi> which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary, or inuolu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary.</p>
               <p>7. The places of S. Ambros and S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin are already anſwered for they define only mortal ſinne.

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:11214:172"/> followeth it as Bel thincketh that ſome ſinnes, are no ſinnes, but only that Some ſinnes are not perfectly ſinnes, as Bellarmin proueth loc. cit. As for the Rhemiſts. dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>btles it is falſe which Bel addeth, that what <note place="margin">Sup. c. 2. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag. 8.</note> ſwarueth from the law is againſt it, as I haue proued againſt his bare aſſertion of the contrary.

            <p>Bel intituleth this ſeuenth article of traditions, though therein he handleth diuerſe other matters, as of the ſufficiencie and perſpicuity of Scriptures, and of the readinge them in vulgar tongues, and by the common people, of the authoritie of Councels and oathes of Biſhops. But theſe he handleth ſo confuſedly &amp; ſo tediouſly, being almoſt as longe in this one article as in al the reſt, as I founde much more difficultie to gather togither, what he ſaied of euery point in different places, and to bringe them to ſome methodical order for the healpe of the readers memory, then I had to frame an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. firſt therefore I wil entreate of Scriptures next of Tradition, then of Councels, and laſtly of Bisſhops oathes.</p>

Ergo they are not to be baptized. Firſt he ſaith they haue faith, &amp; that their faith &amp; profeſſion is to be baptiſed of faithful parents in vnity of the Catholique Church. After he denyeth them to haue faith in act, but to haue faith fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally, and by inclination. How theſe anſwers agree let the Reader iudge. I would know of him. Firſt whence he hath this new point of faith, that baptized infants haue to be borne of faithful parents. Are none borne of heretiks, or Infidels? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. How they make profeſſion of it by words or deeds, and whether Bel by their profeſſion could diſcerne a baptiſed infant from one vnbaptized. Thirdly: how infants

                     <hi>Inclination to faith iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyeth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Bel.

               <p>7. Second concluſion. Al points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith are vertually conteyned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Firſt becauſe it teacheth vs to belieue the Church, which teacheth actually al points of Chriſtian faith, and therfore Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture vertually teacheth vs al. Hereupon wrote S. Auſtin <hi>That in doing what the Church teacheth, we holde the truth of Scriptures, albeit they afforde no example thereof, becauſe we therin follow the Church, which the Scripture vndoubtedly sheweth.</hi> Secondly becauſe the end of al Gods worde, whether written or vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, is loue of him ſelfe aboue al things, and of our neighbour as our ſelfe, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by that 1. Timoth. 1. v. 5. <hi>The end of the precept is charity,</hi> and Rom. 13. v. 8. <hi>who loueth his neighbour hath fulfilled the law,</hi> and to the better comprehending and obtayning of this end, he referreth al whatſoeuer he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed, and this end being contayned in Scripture it followeth, that the Scripture doth vertually contayne (as a cauſe doth the effect) al points of faith.</p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:11214:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p> 8. And hereupon alſo it followeth that al the reſt of Gods worde whether written, or vnwritten may be called an explication of the foreſaid co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, becauſe it contayneth nothing, but which is vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally contayned in theſe commandements, &amp; thereto referred by God, as to their end, which our Sauiour meant when he ſaid. <hi>In</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 40.</note> 
                  <hi>theſe tvvo commandements, al the lavv and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets hange,</hi> becauſe of them depend, as of their end, al the reſt, which the law and Prophets contayne. And hereupon ſaid S. <note place="margin">S. Epiphan.</note> Epiphan. haer. 65. <hi>That we may tel the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euery queſtion, out of the conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi> He ſaid not out of ſcripture. For al can not be taken thence, as him ſelfe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth haer. 61. but <hi>of the conſequence of them,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe al queſtions are reſolued out of the Scriptures, or out of that which followeth of them, as the effect of rhe cauſe. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe two concluſions, we may expound other Fathers, when they ſay al things are contained in Scripture. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they meane not abſolutely of al points of Chriſtian faith, nor of actual containing (as appeareth by that other where they manifeſtely defend Traditions) but either only of points neceſſary to be knowne of euery Chriſtian, or of vertual containing.</p>
               <p>9. Third concluſion: Al points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:11214:178" rendition="simple:additions"/> faith are not actually co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">Al points of Chriſtian faith are not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Scripture.</note> neither clearly nor obſcurely, neither in plaine words, nor in meaning. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bel ſeemeth to graunt, pag. 118. where he admitteth of a thing although not expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly written, yet <hi>vertually</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally contained in Scripture.</hi> And the whole En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Article</hi> 6.</note> Cleargy defyne. <hi>That what may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of Scripture is neceſſary to be beleeued, though it be not read.</hi> But what can be proued, what not, they alone wil be iudges. But whatſoeuer Proteſtants ſay. I proue the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> concluſion. For no where in Scripture it is ſayd, either in plaine words or in meaning. That al the books, chapters, verſes, and ſentences, which in the Bible are admitted for Canonical, are truly Canonical, and Gods pure worde, without the mixture of mans worde.

For beſide that it is ſpoken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reaſon at al, it is againſt reaſon, and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:11214:180"/> ſenſe, to ſay that al the books of Ioſue, Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Kings, and Prophets adde no ſenſe to the law of Moyſes. For where doth the law of Moyſes tel vs of euery worde, or action of euery particuler man, or woeman recorded in the books of the oulde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, written ſince the law was giuen? where is euery worde or deede of euery perticuler perſon in the new Teſtament? And although dyuers actions of Chriſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially his death, and paſſion was prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the law, yet the like can not be thought of euery action, or ſpeech of euery perticuler perſon, ſo that the words or figures of Moyſes law, actually tolde what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer perticuler things ether Prophets, or Euangeliſts euer wrote.

               <p>5. What hath bene ſaid to the place of Deut. 4. may be applyed to the other place Deut. 12. if it be vnderſtood of the moral law, which God gaue to the Iewes. But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I thinke it is to be vnderſtood of the Ceremonial law. Both becauſe it is not ſaid abſolutly what I command that only do, as it would, if it had bene meant of the Moral law: but <hi>That only doe thou to the lord,</hi> which words <hi>(to the lorde)</hi> inſinuate the meaning to be only of the Ceremonial law, &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:11214:181"/> of ſacrifice to be done to God. As alſo immediatly before, God had forbidden the Iewes in their manner of worshipping him to imitate the ceremonyes of Gentils in worshipping their Gods, becauſe they had many abhominable vſes, as of ſacrifizing their children, and ſtreight after concludeth <hi>what I command, thee that only do thou to the lorde, nether adde any thing, nor deminish.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſee that the worde <hi>(Command)</hi> he extended only to ſacrifices, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes, which before he had preſcribed to be done to him ſelfe, and would haue therin no alteration at al.</p>
               <p>6. Nether hindereth this that which <note place="margin">Reinolds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. theſ. p. 207.</note> Reinolds obiecteth. <hi>That mention here is made of ſacrificing children, which is forbidden by the moral law.</hi> For mention is made therof, not as of a thing forbidden there, but as of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of forbidding the Iewes, in worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God to imitate Gentils, becauſe (ſaith God) <hi>they ſacrifice children,</hi> And of this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial law very likely it is. that God abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly <note place="margin">Ceremonial lavv perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the Ievves and vvhy.</note> would haue no addition, or alteration at al to be made, vntil it were quite abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt. And the like reaſon is not of Gods law concerning faith, and manners. For there being no ſuch difference in the Ceremonies of the law, but what ſome Iewes obſerued al might alike, expedient it
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:11214:182"/> was that al the Ceremonies should be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed at once, to the end al might worship God after the ſame manner, eſpecially ſeeing the Iewes were as S.

               <p>7.

The firſt is in math. 23. <hi>This becauſe it hath no authority from Scripture is as eaſely reiected, as it is affirmed.</hi> The ſecond is in pſal. 86. where vpon that verſe <hi>Dominus narrabit in ſcripturis populorum.</hi> he ſaith. <hi>God vvil shew not by worde, but by Scripture, that excepting the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, what is ſaid afterward shal haue no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> The third place is in Hierem. c. 4. <hi>That we muſt not follow the error of our Aunceſtors or parents, but authority of Scriptures, and command of God teaching.</hi> Anſwer: In the firſt place S. Hierom ſpeaketh of a perticuler opinion vz: That Zacharias who was ſlaine betwene the Temple and the Altar was S. Ihon Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts father: which he ſuppoſeth to haue bene no Apoſtolical Tradition, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of it ſaith, becauſe it is not proued out of Scripture, it is as eaſely reiected as affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But what S. Hierom writeth of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler opinion helde without tradition, Bel can not iuſtly extend to certaine Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The ſecond place maketh nothing
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:11214:194"/> againſt vs. Becauſe the Traditions of the Church were taught by the Apoſtles, and not by any other afterward. And S. Hieroms meaning is to deny, that any man may teach of his owne worde, and authority any new doctrine, as Montanus, and ſuch like Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks did, but only that, which they recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the Apoſtles, who were as S. Paul ſaith, Eph. 2. v. 20 <hi>our foundation.</hi> The thirde place maketh les to the purpoſe. For tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no error of Anceſtors. And Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we graunt to be followed, but not it alone, but (as S. Hierom ſaith) <hi>the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God teaching</hi> whether it be by writing or tradition. As for traditions S. Hierom plainly alloweth them, Dialog. cont. Lucif. where he confeſſeth it <hi>to be the cuſtome of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">S. Hierome.</note>

               <p>16. Many more Fathers I might alleadge for traditions. But I content my ſelfe with the teſtimonies of them, whom Bel brought for the contrary. Let the indifferent Reader weigh the places cited by him, and me, and vprightly iudge as he tendreth his ſaluation; Whether the holy Fathers reiected, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced eccleſiaſtical traditions. Perhaps Bel
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:11214:195"/> wil anſwer. That the Fathers contradict them ſelfes, and ſay as the falſe mother did. <hi>Let them be nether myne nor thine, but be deuided.</hi>

               <p>2. His ſecond anſwer is: <hi>That S.

               </head>
               <p>FIRST concluſion, it is not neceſſary to al ſorts of people, that deſire to attaine to eternal life to read Scripturs. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:11214:202" rendition="simple:additions"/> auoucheth Bel pag. 103. &amp; 109. wherin he exceedeth the heretike Pelagius who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not reading, but only knowledge of Scripture for to be without ſinne, &amp; therby condemned a great part of Chriſtians as S. Hierom writeth dialog. 1. cont. Pelag. But <note place="margin">S. Hierom.</note> it is ſo manifeſt as it needeth no proofe. For how should they doe that can not read? Doth Bel thinke Scripture to be like a neck verſe, that who can not read it, shal be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged? where doth God command euery one vpon paine of death to read Scripturs? whence came this new law which Bel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth? But marke Reader, Proteſtants taught at firſt that no works were neceſſary to ſaluation. And now Bel auoucheth one more (vz. reading of Scripturs) then euer Catholiques dreamed on.</p>
               <p>2. Second concluſion, It is not expedient <note place="margin">See S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor. Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen. in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loget. &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. 1. de Theolog.</note> for euery one of the vulgar ſort to read Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturs. This I proue becauſe vnlearned, and vnſtable perſons depraue the Scripture to their owne perdition. Many of the vulgar ſort are vnlearned, and vnſtable. Therfore many of them ought not to read Scripture. The Minor is euident. The Maior is auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by S. Peter 2. c. 3. v. 16. and proued by <note place="margin">Hacket.

And in truth the Proteſtants counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:11214:202" rendition="simple:additions"/> of common people to read Scripturs, is much like to the Diuels perſwading of Eue to eat the Apple. He asked Eue why God forbad her to eat? they aske: why the Church forbiddeth vs to read? And both anſwering alike: He replyeth you shal not die but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like Gods. They ſay you shal not fal into errors, but become like Deuines. And the euent is like in both. Eue by eating fel out of Paradiſe, and incurred death: ſimple people by reading dye in ſoule, &amp; fal out of the Church.</p>
               <p>3. But ſaith Bel. A good should not be <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bel p.</hi> 107.</note> taken wholy from the godly for fault of the bad. Anſwere. The godly are not debarred from reading Scripture if they be deſyrous, and iudged by their Paſtors to be ſuch as wil reape good therby. Neuertheles they ought not without lycence, leſt as S. Auſtin <note place="margin">S. Auguſtin. lib. de vtilit. credend. c. 10. tom. 6.</note> writeth in the like caſe. <hi>Though they hurt not them ſelfs by reading, they may hurt others by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. As he that could fly be made to go leſt his example prouoke others to ſo perilous attempt. This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the prouidence of true religion,</hi> and <hi>deliuered from our Auncestors, and to alter this courſe were nothing els then to ſeeke a ſacriledgious way to true religion.</hi> Moreouer though a thing be good in it ſelfe, yet it is not good but to ſuch as know how to vſe it; But euery one of the common people knoweth not how
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:11214:203" rendition="simple:additions"/> to vſe Scripture. For as Gregory Nazianzen <note place="margin">S. Nazianz. orat. Quod non liceat ſemper &amp; publice de Deo conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The firſt point is not againſt vs, who graunt that in reading Scripture we may find al things neceſſary. But the queſtion now is whither it be better for euery one to find ſuch things him ſelfe out of Scripture or no. As for the ſecond point S. Chriſoſtom only ſaith that it is a shame not to exact more diligence of men in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſermons, then in gathering mony. <hi>At leſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be ready to heare what others haue</hi>

                  <hi>gathered, and beſtovv ſo much diligence in hearing vvhat is ſaid as in gathering mony. For though it be a shame to exact but ſo much of you, yet wil we be content if you performe ſo much.</hi> The third point is eaſely anſwered: becauſe he ſaith <note place="margin">Innumera mala nata ſunt quod ſcripturae ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantur. Chriſt. ſup. <hi>vntruth</hi> 84</note> not: That much miſcheef commeth of not reading (as Bel falſly affirmeth pag. 105) but of not knowing the Scripture: vz if men wil nether read it them ſelfs, nor heare it readd and expounded by preachers. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he thinke that much miſcheef can come of not reading Scripture, if ſo be it be heard, ſeeing he promiſeth to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent if men wil heare it.</p>
               <p>5. An other place he citeth out of S. <note place="margin">

                  <hi>from not Canonical by themſelues, as light is from darknes.</hi> This he proueth <hi>becauſe Gods worde is called a light, and a lantherne, ſayd to shyne to men ſpiritual men ſayd to iudge al things, the vnction to teach al things, and Chriſts sheepe ſayd to heare, and know his voyce.</hi> But this is eaſely refelled. Firſt becauſe though Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel were a faithful, &amp; holy man, and God ſpake thriſe to him, yet he tooke his worde for mans worde, vntil Hely the high Prieſt tolde him it was Gods worde 1. Reg. 3. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon was faithful, and yet knew not at firſt that it was God that ſpake vnto him by an <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iudic.</hi> 6.</note> Angel, and therfore demanded a miracle in confirmation of it Iudic. 6. The like may
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:11214:219"/> be ſaid of Manues wife Iud. 13. and perhaps of Manue him ſelfe. For though in his prayer he profeſſe that God had ſent the Angel, whom he tooke to be a man, yet doth he not profeſſe that God had ſent him eſpecially, and perticulerly to do that meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and ſeeing he knew not, that it was an Angel, vntil he aſcended in the flame of the ſacrifice, yea ſeemed to doubt whether his words would proue true, when he ſayd. <hi>If thy ſpeech be fulfilled,</hi> likely it is that he was not certaine that it was Gods worde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was certaine, that it was his Angel. Likewiſe S. Peter was faithful, and yet at <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 12.</note> firſt he knew not, that it was an Angel that ſpake, and deliuered him act. 12.</p>
               <p>14. Secondly the true ſenſe, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Gods worde, is not ſo euident to the faithful, for to diſcerne it from the falſe ſenſe, as light is diſcerned from darknes. Ergo, nether Gods true worde is ſo euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned by them from the falſe worde. The conſequence I proue, becauſe Gods worde conſiſteth more in his meaning then in letters. <hi>Let vs not thincke</hi> (ſaith S. Hierom) <note place="margin">S. Hierom. in Calat. 1. &amp; dialog. con. Lucif.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Ghoſpel is in the words of Scripturs, but in the ſence.</hi> Againe: <hi>Scripturs conſiſt not in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding but in vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding.</hi> And therfore if it be diſcerned by it ſelfe, it is rather diſcerned by the ſenſe, then by the letters or words.
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:11214:219"/> The antecedent I shal proue hereafter, and it is euident by the example of the Apoſtles, who though they were faithful oftentymes vnderſtood not Chriſts meaning, eſpecially when he ſpake in parables, or of his paſſion by the example of the faithful Eunuch, and by the teſtimony of S. Peter 2. Pet. 3. v. 16.</p>
               <p>15. Thirdly the diſtinction of Scripturs from not Scriptures, is not ſo euident, as the diſtinction of light from darknes is. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, they are not ſo eaſely diſcerned. The conſequence is euident. The Antecedent I proue, becauſe then no man could erre in it, as none can erre in the diſtinction of light from darknes. Bel ſaith. <hi>That only faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful can diſcerne Scriptures.</hi> But this conuinceth that their diſtinction is not ſo euident as that of light from darknes: for this al men, yea beaſts of ſight can diſcerne. Nether can <note place="margin">Faith can not diſcerne any thing clearly.</note> faith be needful to diſcerne light, or any thing which is ſo euident, becauſe as S. Paul ſaith Hebr. 11. v. 1. <hi>It is an argument of things not appearing,</hi> and it breadeth certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not euidency in the beleeuer.</p>
               <p>16. Beſide if faithful could as clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Scriptures, as they can light, they should no ſooner here a ſentence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then they should diſcerne it to be Scripture, as they no ſooner ſee light, then
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:11214:220"/> they diſcerne it from darknes, which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth to be falſe: yea Luther a faithful man (in Bels opinion) could not diſcerne, yea could not beleeue S. Iames e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle <note place="margin">Luther. edit. Iennen. Surius Ann. 1522.</note> to be canonical, but called it abſolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſtrawish thing, as his books firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and diuers others teſtify, and Whitaker <note place="margin">VVhitaker. lib. 1. contr. Duraeum p. 22.</note> dare not deny, yea confeſſeth that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>it ſtrawish in reſpect of other epiſtles,</hi> which is more then to deny it to be Gods worde. Wherfore let Bel make his choyſe, whether Luther was not faithful, or S. Iames epiſtle not ſo euidently diſcerned by the faithful to be Gods worde as light is. Finally Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants admit one Tradition, as neceſſary to diſcerne Scriptures, or Bel lyeth pag. 135. Ergo: Scriptures are not ſo euidently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by them ſelues as light is. For what neede is there of an other thing to diſcerne light, or any thing ſo euident.</p>
               <p>17. Nether haue Bels arguments any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to anſwer. For Gods worde is called a lantherne, or light, not becauſe it is ſo euident, as light is; but becauſe, being once beleeued to be Gods worde, it sheweth vs the way to heauen, as light doth to earthly places, and thereupon it is called of the Pſalmiſt a <hi>lantherne to our feete.</hi> And for the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 118.</note> ſame cauſe faith is called light, though it be an obſcure knowledge. Hebr. 11. v. 1. and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:11214:220"/> by it we ſee God only <hi>in aenigmate:</hi> 1. Cor. 13. v. 12. and not clearly. And in like ſort S. Paul 2. Corinth. 4. v. 4. (where Bel citeth <note place="margin">2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 4.</note> amiſſe. c. 5.) ſaith the Ghoſpel shineth, not becauſe it is euident, and cleare, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it expelleth the ignorance of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which metaphorically is called dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. That of the ſpiritual man 1. Corinth. 2. v. 15. is nothing to the purpoſe, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe al faithful are not ſpiritual, but ſome carnal 1. Corinth. 3. v. 1. 2. 3. and Galath. 6. v. 1. and therfore may we better infer that the Ghoſpel is not euident to al faithful: As alſo becauſe S. Paul explicateth, not by what means the ſpiritual man iudgeth al things, whether by the euidency of the things (as Bel wold haue him to iudge Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) or by ſome outward teſtimony. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer S.

Finally Chriſts sheep heare, and know his voice Ioan. 10. <note place="margin">

Nether deny we, that God inwardly moueth our harts to beleeue it, only we ſay that therto he vſeth alſo the teſtimony of the holy Church, nor ordinarily moueth any therto, without the external teſtimony of the Church. wherfore albeit it be moſt true that we beleeue the Scripture to be Gods worde, becauſe God moueth vs therto: yet
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:11214:221"/> falſe it is to deny, that we beleeue it not alſo, becauſe the Church doth teach it.

               <p>21. Likewiſe it is againſt S. Auſtin: Firſt he thinketh (as Bel confeſſeth) the Church to concurre, with the inward motion of the holy Ghoſt to the faith of the Ghoſpel: But faith of the Ghoſpel, to which the holy Ghoſt inwardly concurreth is deuine. Ergo to this the Church concurreth: Beſids S. Auſtin affirmeth, that authority holdeth <note place="margin">Cont. epiſt. fundam. c. 4. tom. 6.</note> him in the Catholique Church. And that if the authority of Catholiques were weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he wold not beleeue the Ghoſpel, which he would neuer ſay, if his deuine faith did not depend vpon the Catholiques authority. Moreouer what more euident then the holy Fathers, when they ſpeake of beleeuing the Ghoſpel, they meane of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, and Chriſtian faith. And what faith should S. Auſtin meane of, but of ſuch faith
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:11214:223"/> as he exhorted the Maniches vnto, which was deuine. And in the place alleadged by Bel, he calleth outward teaching helpe to faith, and only meaneth, that a man can not learne faith of man alone, without al in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teaching of God. And therfore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. That <hi>if he be not within, who teacheth the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Tract. 3. in 1. Ioan. 10. 9.</note>

For the authority of Gods Church is not meere humane, but in ſome ſort deuine, as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by God him ſelfe appointed to teſtify his truth. And therfore he ſaid, <hi>vvho heareth</hi>

               <p>22. Wherfore Bel not truſting much to this shift flyeth to an other: vz. <hi>That S.

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:11214:224"/> anſwer, and proofs are moſt falſly auouched vpon S Auſtin. For if he had meant the foreſaid words of him ſelfe only, as when he was a Manichiſt, he wold not haue ſaid, <hi>Non crederem niſi commoueret</hi> &amp;c. I wold not beleeue, vnles the Church did commoue me: <hi>But non credidiſsem, niſi commouiſset:</hi> I had not or wold not haue beleeued, vnleſſe the Church had commoued me.

               </p>
               <p>23. Bels proofs are nothing but his owne vntruths. For though it be true. That the Scripture is of greater authority then the Church, yet nether doth S. Auſtin ſay it in that place, nether maketh it any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. For albeit the Scripturs be in it ſelfe of greater authority, yet the authority of the Church is both infallible, and more euident to me. And what maruel if for an infallible authority more euident, I beleeue an other though greater, yet not ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:11214:224"/> As S. Ihon was ſent to giue teſtimony of Chriſt Ioan. 1 v. 8. and yet far inferior to Chriſt. Nether ſaith S. Auſtin. That truth of Scripture is to be preferred before au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and conſent of Catholiques. But Bel added the worde <hi>Scripturs</hi> as though S. Auſtin meant, that their truth could be knowne, without the authority of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, or be oppoſit vnto it, which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly denyeth. Nether meaneth he of the truth of Scripturs (which the Manichiſt againſt whom he wrote reiected almoſt wholy, and he him ſelfe profeſſeth he could <note place="margin">S. Auſtin ſpeaketh of moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent truth and ſuch is not the Scri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ptures.</note> not take for truth, if it were contrary to Catholiques) but of any knowne truth in general, which he ſaith (and truly) is to be preferred before al authority oppoſit vnto it, becauſe ſuch authority is not infallible, but falſe, and deceitful. And therfore he ſpeaketh vppon ſuppoſition, that if it were true (which other where he auoucheth to be impoſſible) that Manichiſts taught truth, and Catholiques error, <hi>then their truth vvere to be preferred before the name of Catholiques, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of nations, and authority begun with miracles, nourished vvith hope, encreaſed vvith charity, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished vvith antiquity, and ſucceſsion of Prieſts, euen from the ſeat of Peter, to vvhom our Lord after his reſurrection commanded his sheep to be fed vnto this preſent Bishop.</hi> But ſaith the glorious

               </head>
               <p>THERE are certaine and vndoubted Apoſtolical traditions. This is againſt Bel pag. 128 129. &amp;c. But I proue it, becauſe the traditions of the Byble to be Gods worde, of the perpetual virginity of our B.

Beſids if in the law of nature, and Moyſes, traditions were keapt certaine, why not in the law of grace. But more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wil the concluſion be, if we deſcend to perticuler traditions, which Bel endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bel p.</hi> 128. 129.</note> to proue vncertaine. Firſt he ſetteth-downe this Propoſition. <hi>Vnwritten traditions are ſo vncertaine as the best learned papiſts are at great conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion about them</hi> This he proueth in the tradition of Eaſter, about which conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>S. Victor P. &amp; the Bishops of Aſia aboue</hi> 1400 <hi>years agoe both earnestly alleadging Apoſtolical traditions. Likewiſe S. Anicetus, and S.

               </p>
               <p>2. Marke good Reader his concluſion, and proofs therof, and thou wilt neede no
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:11214:226"/> more to aſſure thy ſelfe of the truth of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane religion: His concluſion is: That traditions are ſo vncertaine as the learne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Papiſts contend about them. This he proueth: becauſe S. Victor P. contended with the Bishops of Aſia. S. Policarpe with S. Anicetus P. Surely he meaneth that theſe men were Papiſts, or els his concluſion is vnproued. And conſequently Papiſts, and Popery were 1400. years agoe within 200. <note place="margin">

                  </note> both agreed againſt him, thar there are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; that they are of great weight, ſeeing ſuch great Saints ſo long agoe did ſo ſtowtly defend them, on what ſide now is Bel, who ſtowtly oppugneth, what Saints with al Gods Church ſo long agoe defended? what need more proofe of traditions or of Papiſtry?

               <p>3. But now to Bels argument. The tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of keeping Eaſter was vncertaine 200 years after Chriſt. Ergo it is now.

And though it had bene then vncertaine, Bel could no more infer it to be ſo now, then he can infer the ſame of many parts of the Bible, which both then, and long after were doubted of, and yet accepted now of Proteſtants.

               <p>3. He obiecteth that Bellarmin lib. 2. de Concil. cap. 11. writeth: that is the true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the counſel, which is made of the greater part.

                     <hi>Bel p.</hi> 121. 122.</note> Councels. A goodly reaſon ſutely: Two Catholique writers agree not whether should be accompted the decree of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, if the greater number of Bishops should define againſt the Pope, and the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer number of Bishops. Ergo no councel in our dayes is certaine. As if nothing were certaine, if two Catholiques diſagree about it. Wil Bel allowe mee to argue ſoe againſt Proteſtants? I beleeue I should finde ſcarce any one pointe of faith certaine amongſt them. But he should rather hane inferred: Bellarmin, Canus, and al Catholique wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters agree, that it is the decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and certaine truth, which the greater part of Bishops defineth, and the Pope confirmeth.

Other being depoſed or vexed appealed to Popes, as S. Athanaſius and Peter of Alexandria, S. Paul, S. Chriſoſtom: and S.

Chriſoſtom, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret, and other Doctors and ſaints of the Eaſt church, both the Emperour and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arche of Conſtantinople did in S.

               <p>7. Now to his reaſon. Bellarmin ſaith. The Emperour of the Eaſt would haue ſate in Councel aboue the Pope. Ergo, the Eaſt church neuer acknowledged his primacy. Who ſeeth not the manifolde weaknes of this reaſon. Firſt I deny, that any religious Emperour of the Eaſt would haue ſate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Pope in Councel, as appeareth by the fact of the two great Emperours Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantin, and Theodoſius before rehearſed,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:11214:240"/> and by Iuſtinus humbling himſelfe vnto the Pope proſtrate on the ground, Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians <note place="margin">See Art. 1. c. 6. parag. 6.</note> lowly adoring, and Iuſtinian the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond his kiſſing of his feeet. Is it likely that theſe who ſo honoured the Pope out of Councel, would haue ſate aboue him in Councel? And albeit one grecian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, after both religion, and reuerence thereto was decayed in Greece, and the whole nation fallen into Schiſme and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, did in the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of Florence attempt <note place="margin">Concil. Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note> to ſit aboue the Pope, yet the like is not to be thought of other religious Chriſtian Emperours, whereof, diuers as Bel teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth art. 1. pag. 17. humbled themſelues, and yeelded euen their ſoueraigne rights to Popes. Yea the ſelfe ſame Emperour, who by ſome euil ſuggeſtion would haue ſate aboue the Pope, would at his firſt meeting with him haue kneeled vnto him. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <note place="margin">Concil. Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. ſup.</note> that the grecian Emperours, by reaſon of their temporal ſuperiority, would haue ſitten aboue the Pope, Doe they therefore deny his ſpiritual primacy? No more ſurely then a gentleman doth deny his paſtours ſpiritual authority ouer him, becauſe he wil ſit aboue him. Did not the grecians euen in the Florentin Councel, where they attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">In lit. vnio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</note> to place the Emperour aboue the Pope, defyne together with the Latins, that the

Becauſe Bishops muſt not examin the doctrine, which the Pope deliuereth iudicially out of S. Peters chaire, as ſupreame paſtour of Gods church, but only that, wherein he vttereth
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:11214:242" rendition="simple:additions"/> his owne priuate opinion.</p>
               <p>3. And as for the laſt point; Bishops ſweare no rebellion: Both becauſe they ſweare to defend the Popes primacie, only according to Gods worde, and holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, which admit no rebellion. As alſo <note place="margin">

But indeed it is no keeping at al, nor a point of Gods children but of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, and a true breaking of them. For how are they Gods children, if they loue him not, how loue they him, if they damnably offend? If you loue me ſaith Chriſt Ioh. 14. <note place="margin">S.

And to keepe Gods commaundements in this ſort, is ſubſtantially to keepe them, becauſe we breake not the end of them, which is charity; and yet not perfectly, &amp; exactly. as who ſtealeth but trifles keepeth the Princes lawes, though not perfectly; but if he ſteale great matters, he is ſaid no more to keepe <note place="margin">1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 1. 7. 5.</note> but to breake them.

               <p>3. Firſt therfore I proue it. becauſe a young man tolde Chriſt <hi>he had kept al the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>commaundements from his youth.</hi> Bel anſwereth that S. Hierom ſaith he lyed, and S. Auſtin <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bel p.</hi> 150.</note> thinketh he ſpake more prowdly then tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">S. Auguſtin. epiſt. 89.</note> neuertheles more probable it is that he ſpake truly, becauſe not only our Sauiour did not rebuke him (as likely it is he would haue done, if he had tolde him a lye) but, as S. Marcke teſtifieth, <hi>beheld him, &amp; loued him,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marc.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 21.</note> and ſaid, <hi>one thing is wanting to thee, goe ſel whatſoeuer thou haſt, and giue it to the poore, and come, and follow mee.</hi> If the mans ſpeeche had bene a lye, it would not haue prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Chriſts loue, but his offence; and if he had broken Gods commaundements, Chriſt would haue aduertiſed him whome he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, rather of keeping the things which he commaunded, then which he counſelled, as is the giuing al we haue to the poore. Wherfore S. Chriſoſtome hom. 64. in Math. <note place="margin">S. Chryſoſt.</note> ſaith, this man was <hi>no diſsembler.</hi> And S. Hierom. dialog. 2. contra Pelag. affirmeth, <note place="margin">S.

<pb n="424" facs="tcp:11214:245"/> of our lorde; which euidently conuinceth that his ſpeeche was true: for Chriſt could not loue him for a lye. Neither wil Bel I hope maruel, that we expound S. Mathew rather by S. Marcke, then by S. Hierome, and S. Auſtin, eſpecially ſeeing S. Hierome alrered his opinion, ad S. Auſtin ſpake but doubtfully, ſaying <hi>I thinke.</hi> Neuertheles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome fathers haue thought that the mans ſpeeche was not true, Catholiques rely not vpon this argument.</p>
               <p>4. Secondly S. Paule ſaith. For not the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 13.</note> hearers of the law are iuſt with God, but the Doers of the law shal be iuſtified. Ergo there are ſome Doers of the law, and it is poſſible to be done. Bel anſwereth that the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 151.</note> Apoſtle ſpake not abſolutly, but vpon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of a thinge, which (ſaith he) is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that there were doers of the law, for ſuch ſaith Bel, <hi>should be iuſtified by their worke, though they could not glory in them.</hi> But that S.

Firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the firſt part of the ſentence he ſpake abſolutly of hearers, and not vpon any impoſſible ſuppoſal, when he ſaid <hi>they are not iuſt.</hi> Ergo: in the ſecond parte he ſpake ſo of Doers, when he ſaid <hi>they shal be iuſtified.</hi> Wherfore as wel may Bel ſay there are no hearers, as no doers of the law. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:11214:245"/> becauſe in the next verſe before, he <note place="margin">

But only about the meane in general to come to heauen, what that was, which the man ſuppoſing to bee good, asked what good he should doe to come thither (which queſtion of his is common either to faith, or works, or both; for al include doing good) And our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our anſwered him, <hi>If thou wilt enter</hi> (not this way, nor that way, but abſolutly) <hi>into life, keepe the commaundements.</hi> As Dauid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding <note place="margin">

               <p>MANY holy Fathers I might alleadge for this verity, but I wil content my ſelfe with two only, whome Bel obiecteth againſt him ſelfe, and vndertaketh to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. <note place="margin">S. Hierom. See S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom in cap. 5. Mathei.</note> S. Hierom dialog. 1. contr. Pelag. we confeſſe (ſaith he) God hath giuen poſsible
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:11214:249"/> commaundements, leſt he should be author of iniuſtce. Beholde our concluſion both affirmed, and proued. And Dialog 2. I ſay a man may be without vice, which in greeke is called <hi>cacia,</hi> but not <hi>anamartyton,</hi> that is without ſinne, which is as much as if he had ſaid. He can be without mortal, but not without venial ſinne. Againe: God hath not commaunded impoſſible things, but hath aſcended vp to ſuch height of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as for their great difficulty he may ſeeme to haue commaunded almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things. Againe: we curſe their blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, who ſaie. That God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to man any impoſſible thing. This Bel alleadgeth out of his 3. &amp; fourth booke <note place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 153.</note> againſt Pelagians, whereas he wrote but one epiſtle, and three bookes or Dialogues againſt Pelagians. But it is in his epiſtle to Damaſus de expoſit. fidei. And therein S. <note place="margin">

                  </note> Hierom curſeth this blaſphemy of Bel: <hi>God hath giuen vs thoſe commaundements, which we can not poſsibly keepe.</hi> Likewiſe S. Auſtin ſer. 61. de temp. God could not commaund any impoſſible thinge, becauſe he is iuſt. The ſame he repeateth lib. de natur. &amp; grat. cap. 69. and lib. 2 de pen. mer. &amp; remiſſ. and in pſal. 56. I can not doubt (ſaith he) that God hath neither commaunded any impoſſible thinge to man, nor that any thinge is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:11214:250"/> to God to helpe, wherby it may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>one which he commaundeth.</p>
               <p>2. For auoiding theſe authorities Bel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſeth three ſhiftes. Firſt, that Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements were poſſible to vs before Adams fal. Secondly, that they were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to Chriſt, whoſe keeping them is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ours Thirdly, that euen to vs they are now poſſible to be kept imperfectly, though not perfectly, which is (ſaith he) the doctrine of Aquinas: yet ſeeing that <note place="margin">S. Thom. 2. 2. quaeſt. 44. art. 6. <hi>vntruth.</hi>
                  </note> none of theſe shiftes would ſerue, he falleth to proue, that we may be iuſtly damned for not doing impoſſible matters; becauſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants vnbaptized, are damned for original ſinne, which ſaith he they could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly auoid. And in the margent calleth this a dilemma, which no Papiſt can auoid: But none of theſe shiftes wil ſuffice. For S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome <note place="margin">S. Hierom.</note> epiſt. ad Cteſiph. writeth, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements are poſſible to vs by Gods grace. And dialog. 2. cit. That they are ſo poſſible, as that Dauid we know (ſaith he) hath done them. If they be poſſible to vs, then not to Chriſt alone; and if Dauid did them, man after Adams ſinne may doe them. And the reaſon which he, and S. Auſtin af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him giueth of Gods iuſtice, conuinceth the ſame. For it is againſt his iuſtice, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund vs impoſſible things, as wel after
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:11214:250"/> Adams ſinne as before. Likewiſe S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin after the Apoſtle ſaith, that the iuſtice <note place="margin">S. Auguſtin. ſermon. 6. de verb. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtol. cap. 9. Rom. 8. v. 4.</note> of the law is fulfilled in vs. Ergo not in Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p>3. As for the thirde shifte. S. Thomas ſaith indeed, that the precept of louing God withal our hart &amp;c. can not be perfectly kept, but imperfectly, yet in a ſenſe quite contrary to Bel. Perfectly ſaith he is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept kept, when the very end intended by the commaunder is atchieued. Imperfectly, when albeit the end be not attained, yet the way vnto it is not left. As a ſouldier figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ouercomming, perfectly fulfilleth the commaund of his captaine, bidding him fight. And an other fighting, and doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the duety of a ſouldier, but not ouercomming, fulfilleth it, but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie. Whereby we ſee plainly, that though S. Thomas deny, that the end, (vz. to bee wholy vnited to God) for which he gaue that precept of loue, be not poſſible in this life, yet he graunteth that we may ſo fight, or labour for the attaining it, as wee doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the order commaunded by God, or the duety of a ſpiritual ſouldier. Which is indeed ſubſtantially to keepe the precepts, though S. Thomas in reſpect of keeping them, and alſo attayning the end, for which they were made, cal it imperfect
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:11214:251"/> keeping. For ſeeing God commaundeth not the end, but only intendeth it (as S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas ſaith) if the order and meanes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded be fulfilled, then ſurely the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement is fulfilled, though the end of the commaunder, which is only intended, not commaunded be not attayned.</p>
               <p>4. And as for Bels dilemma it is eaſily anſwered, and therefore might haue bene better lefte out (as himſelfe writeth in the margent) For though Infants after they haue ſinned, and eaten the aple in Adam, cannot auoide the guilt thereof, but muſt needs contract it by origin from Adam. As a man after he hath committed adultery can not but contract the guilt of adultery: Yet becauſe as Infants ſinned in Adam, ſo they might haue not ſinned in him, and ſo haue auoided the guilt of ſinne, falſly doth Bel <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bel pag.</hi> 51. <hi>art.</hi> 4.</note> ſay they could not poſſibly auoide it. And I wonder why hauing taught before, that concupiſcence (which is the effect of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Contradict.</hi> 21.</note> ſinne) is voluntary, he wil now ſay that Infants could not poſſibly auoide ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſinne. But it is his cuſtome to gainſay himſelfe.</p>
               <p>5. By reaſon alſo it may be proued, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Reaſon."/> Gods precepts are poſſible. For beſides, that if the law were impoſſible, ſinne might be inuoluntary. I aske to whom Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:11214:251"/> are impoſſible? To man alone? and that is not the queſtion nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed of any Catholique: or to man with Gods grace? and that is contrary to S. Paule ſaying <hi>I can doe al things in him that ſtrengthneth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Paul Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> 14 <hi>verſ.</hi> 13 <hi>S. Iohn.</hi>

                     <hi>S. Paul. v.</hi> 9.</note> not. Likewiſe if God commaunded impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, he should be the Author of iniuſtice, or vniuſt; as affirme S. Hierom dialog. 1. contr. Pelag. and S. Auſtin de nat. &amp; grat. cap. 69. and ſerm. 61. de temp. For it is an vniuſt law which is impoſſible, and to punish breakers were againſt right, and equity. As Bel himſelfe would graunt if vpon paine of death he were bid to flie to heauen, and executed if he did not. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. Hierom epiſt. ad Cteſiphont: wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus. <note place="margin">S. Hieron.</note> we pronounce the commaunder vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, whiles we complaine, that the very Author of equity, hath commaunded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible things. And Simon Magus (ſaith Vincent. Lirinen.) made God Author of <note place="margin">Vincent. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin.</note> ſinne, in affirming vs to ſinne of neceſſity.

Iames meaneth of venial ſinnes, as idle words are, whereof he ſpeaketh in the ſame verſe. And though Bel replie, that he hath already proued, that euery ſinne is mortal in it owne nature, yet neither is that true, <note place="margin">Art. 6. cap. 6.</note> as before is shewed, nether though it were, could it diſproue my anſwer.

               <p>2. Next he alleadgeth S. Paules wordes <note place="margin">

But in truth it maketh more againſt him, then for him. For S. Paules intention was
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:11214:252"/> to proue, that faith in Chriſt was to iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and that the works of the bare law without faith were not ſufficient.

That as long as there is any thing of carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, which may be bridled by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayning, God is not loued <hi>(omnimodo)</hi> alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with al the ſoule.

Auſtins meaning is herein himſelfe explicateth, ſaying, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of louing God withal our ſoule is not <hi>omnimodo</hi> altogether fulfilled whilſt we haue inordinate motions. He denyeth not ſubſtantial fulfilling which auoideth ſinne (yea lib. de ſpir. &amp; liter. cap. vlt. affirmeth, <note place="margin">S.

Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, as himſelfe, ſpeaketh this only, if the precept of loue be vnderſtood of affectual charity, or charity in worke, and graunteth that ſo it is fulfilled, if it be perfectly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, as (ſaid he a litle before) it may be in this life by Gods grace. Beſides this I ſay, immediatly before the words which Bel cyteth, he graunteth, that <hi>initium perfectum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> the beginning and perfection of charity may be experienced by Gods grace in this life. If perfection be had, ſurely the precept is fulfilled. For (as himſelfe ſaith ſone after) doeſt thou not thincke is ſufficient to the fulfilling the precept of louing thie neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, if thou obſerue it perfectly. And Bel pag. 151. graunteth, that who perfectly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth the law shal be iuſtifyed.</p>
               <p>4. And though he differ, or (as he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) defend the conſummation of charity to the next life, and therefore accoumpt the precept of charity impoſſible, as far forth as it imbraceth the conſummation, yet he
